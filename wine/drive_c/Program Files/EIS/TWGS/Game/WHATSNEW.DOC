                               Introduction

Version 3 brings multiplayer interaction to the popular DOS BBS game, with
fully integrated chat systems, real-time global messaging, status reports
and combat.  A completely new file system should remove all known "cheats"
from the game and make loopholes a thing of the past.

                            Overview of Changes

The most notable changes in Trade Wars 2002 v3 are its interactive
capabilities.  Trade Wars has always been a "multiplayer" game, but the DOS
version was never designed to handle multiple players in the game
simultaneously.  This new version upgrades the DOS Trade Wars game to the
level of the Major BBS "interactive Trade Wars".  For example,

     In previous versions, a player entering the game would receive a
     "snap-shot" of the universe.  The player was essentially alone,
     because, even though others occupied the universe, they were "frozen"
     for the duration of the game session.  Aliens, Ferrengi, and Feds only
     existed within that player's universe, and their movement was triggered
     by the player's movements.  The new version breaks down the barriers
     between you and the other players.  While playing, you will see other
     players and non-players moving from sector to sector, landing on ports
     and planets, and even attacking one-another.

     Previously, there was no need for a means of communication beyond
     simple e-mail.  The new version requires a more instantaneous,
     interactive form of communication.  These needs are met with not one,
     but four modes of communication in addition to the improved mail
     system.  And these new chat modes aren't even available in the Major
     BBS version.

     For SysOps, the Trade Wars utilities (TEDIT and EXTERN) can now run
     concurrently with the game sessions.  All changes made with these
     utilities will be represented in the games instantaneously.

One feature that hasn't been updated is the reasonable cost of
registration.  At $25 for new registrations, its still an unbeatable
value.  And did I mention that it's FREE to all registered owners of Trade
Wars 2002?

                                                                            3

                         ------------------------
                          New Features - General
                         ------------------------

                              Integrated Chat

Talk to other players through the three globally accessible chat functions
or a fourth available at the Lost Trader's Tavern.  Send one-line quick
messages, or enter a line-wrapping multiple line mode (perfect for those
sessions when you'd rather talk than work).

Federation Comm-Link

     Messages sent over the Fed Comm-Link will be visible to all players
     unless they've disable the channel.

Sub-Space Radio

     Messages are sent over a specified radio frequency.  This is useful
     for corporate conferences.  Conversations are semi-private, but be
     wary of channel surfers.

Hailing Frequencies

     Use this feature to communicate directly to another player on a
     secured channel.  A two-way comm-link can be established through this
     function if both players open the channel.

Tavern Chat

     Engage in conversation at the Lost Trader's Tavern.  A good place for
     corporate meetings, but you never know who's lurking in the crowd.

                                  -------

                            "Who's Playing" List

Display a list of all online players.  For example,

                               Who's Playing

Private John
Captain Gary

There may be many more players in the game, but these are the "live"
players.

                                  -------

                            Real-time Messaging

The Trade Wars universe is more "alive" than ever, as other online players,
Feds, Ferrengi, and Alien Traders carry out their business.  With real-time
notification, you'll be aware of all activity within your current sector.

                                  -------

                                                                            4
                              Global Messaging

There's no longer a need to quit what you're doing to receive or send
messages.  Notifications are displayed from most menus and prompts, and the
chat functions can be accessed globally.  There are some exceptions.  For
example, you won't receive notification of events in your sector when on a
port or a planet (unless you're in a Citadel with a Combat Computer).

                                  -------

                                 NavPoints

Navigation has been simplified with the addition of the NavPoint menus.

Set NavPoints

     Use this option to assign a sector to one of four programmable
     NavPoints.

Move to NavPoint

     This option displays a list of all player assigned NavPoints, Terra
     sector, and StarDock (at SysOp's discretion).  NavPoint sectors in
     FedSpace, or those containing at least one deployed fighter, are
     displayed with a current status report that includes planets and
     ports.  Selecting one of the listed NavPoints will lay in a course for
     that destination.

                                  -------

                                Quick-stats

This new global was added to put your player stats at your fingertips,
wherever you might need them.  Simply type </> from any prompt for a
compact, 3 to 5 line overview of your Trader.

As an alternative, you can toggle the Computer/Personal Settings/Persistent
Info Display on.  This will display the information at the top of the
screen.  Typing </> with this setting active will toggle the display on and
off.

                                  -------

                              "Backtrack" Key

Another feature to simplify navigation is the "backtrack" key.  Use this
command to retreat to the previously occupied sector.  When trading
adjacent port-pairs, this command is quite useful.

                                                                            5


                       ----------------------------
                        Updated Features - General
                       ----------------------------

                            Interactive Combat

Attacking a player is no longer a simple matter of entering a sector and
engaging.  Tracking down and cornering an unwilling opponent is no easy
task!  Your intended victim will receive notification of a potential threat
when your ship enters the sector, and when you power up your weapons.
Since each ship has a different attacking rate, a faster ship will have
time to escape before a slower ship can engage.  With a Holoscanner, you
may be able to track your fleeing prey.  Without one, well, it's a large
universe...

                                  -------

                              Cooperative Play

Cooperative play has reached a new level.  Interact with fellow corporate
members discussing strategies on the Sub-space Radio.  Exchange resources
such as fighters, shields, and mines.  Launch a large scale assault on an
enemy base, or call for backup when your base is attacked.

                                  -------

                          Real-time Ship Movement

Time has more meaning in the Trade Wars universe now that the game is
interactive.  In previous versions, ship movement was instantaneous and
only limited by turn consumption.  In version 3, each ship has a movement
rate determined by it's size, power, and other factors.  These rates can be
modified by the SysOp (cut to 1/4, 1/2, or even doubled), but the relative
speed of the ships will be the same.

The movement rate also effects the attack speed of a ship, since any attack
is delayed by the amount of time it takes your ship to travel to an
adjacent sector.

                                  -------

                   Independent Alien, Ferrengi, and Feds

In previous versions of Trade Wars, the other occupants of the universe
existed only in a player's "snap-shot" of the game.  They were driven
entirely by the actions of that player, and were only visible to that
player.  In version 3, they become an integral part of the universe,
visible to and interacting with all players in the game.  Furthermore,
their movement and activities are not dependent on any player's actions.
You will see them moving freely into and out of your sector, or perhaps
even attacking you or another trader.

                                  -------

                                                                            6
                            Hourly Turn Recovery

Previously, turns were granted on a daily basis, and you needed to exit the
game and reenter in order to receive them.  Now, you will recover spent
turns every hour.  You will receive notification of the recovered turns,
with no need to exit and reenter the game.

                                  -------

                               Daily Taxation

You still can't escape the Federation tax collectors, but at least there's
some relief.  Taxes will be collected only once for each day you enter the
game.  Previous versions had a nasty habit of collecting the full tax rate
each time you entered the game, which made "dropped carriers" quite
expensive.

                                  -------

                            Real-time Game Stats

The DOS versions of Trade Wars have always given real-time statistics for
the "View Game Status" command, but the MBBS version has only given a daily
update.  This version, while more like the MBBS version in many ways,
retains the preferable real-time statistics display.  Now you'll see
immediate changes in such things as deployed fighters, active Aliens, etc.,
and won't have to worry about the accuracy of the report.

                                  -------

                          "New Mail" Notification

You don't have to worry about missing an important piece of
correspondence.  The GMS will notify you immediately when a new piece of
mail has been logged to your account.

                                  -------

                     Stabilized Planet and Port Updates

Changes in these processes have improved the accuracy of high-frequency
updates.  For example, when a port is accessed frequently over a short
period of time, earlier versions of Trade Wars would lose or gain resources
in an uncharacteristic manner.  The results over a long period of time
could be quite noticeable as, for instance, a significant gain in port
product, or an overly large loss of colonists to natural disasters.  The
new approach, while a bit more "fuzzy" over short periods, results in
greater long-term accuracy.

                                  -------

                                                                            7
                      Compatible With Popular Helpers

Our goal in developing version 3 has been to maintain compatibility with
DOS helpers while adding compatibility with MBBS helpers.  This has often
meant that apparently "buggy" behavior has been left in, and often
recreated in newly written code, to maintain this compatibility.  Helpers
are an important part of the Trade Wars experience, and it is our intention
that the most popular helpers be compatible with the new version.  Any
problems that have been overlooked can be brought to the attention of
Epic Interactive Strategy for future revisions.

                                                                            8


                          ----------------------
                           New Features - SysOp
                          ----------------------

                     Automatic v2 to v3 Data Conversion

If you're one of the many SysOps taking advantage of the free upgrade, you
don't have to worry about upsetting your players with a reset.  Version 3
will convert all Trade Wars data file formats from v2.00 on.  Simply
install the new version into your old directory, or copy the old data into
the directory of the new game (back up the data files in any case), and run
TEDIT or Trade Wars.  That's all there is to it.

                                  -------

                           FOSSIL Driver Support

Trade Wars is finally supporting FOSSIL driver.  You'll find options for
setting up the FOSSIL ports in the TEDIT node editor.

                                  -------

                         Modify Ship Movement Delay

Among several new TEDIT settings is this movement delay factor.  It's up to
you to keep the game moving at a reasonable pace, so we've given you the
ability to adjust the base ship movement delay times to 1/4, 1/3, 1/2,
Normal, Double, and None.

                                  -------

                    Self-cleaning Real-time Message File

This file contains all messages passed between players.  Along with lines
of chat text, these messages include all notifications and synchronization
information.  This file could grow quite large even when deleted daily.  In
version 3, these messages are given a lifetime of 10 seconds, after which
they can be freely removed.  The file is purged of these messages whenever
the record count reaches 100 or a player exits the game.  This guarantees
that the file will never grow larger than about 17K.

                                  -------

                        Online System Status Report

This global command will display a report describing various aspects of the
state of the game.  This information can be used to determine if enough or
too much memory has been allocated to the game, how efficiently the game is
responding, etc.  Through various TEDIT and command line options, you can
use this report to optimize your Trade Wars sessions.

                                                                            9


                        --------------------------
                         Updated Features - SysOp
                        --------------------------

         TEDIT and EXTERN Run Concurrently With Trade Wars Sessions

You won't need to bring the game down to run the game editor, or even to
handle nightly EXTERN processing.  These utilities will function properly
when players are in the game, and changes made by them will be reflected
immediately to the players online.

                                  -------

                      Seperate Message and Mail Files

As described in the "New Features" section, the message file is at the root
of Trade Wars interaction.  In order to further limit the size and
complexity of this file, we've split the mail messages out into a seperate
file.  This file, which can be quite large and inefficient, is scanned only
rarely as a player checks for mail.

                                  -------

               Alien, Ferrengi, and Fed Processing Distributed

In previous versions of Trade Wars, these ships have been processed by the
online player.  That was fine for a single-session game, but not for the
multi-session version 3.  The activities of these non-players are now
handled by a process that is divided among all players in the game.
Therefore, the overhead associated with these activities is the same
regardless of the number of players online at any given time.

                                  -------

                Some Player Activities Limited to Once Daily

Some activities have been taken advantage of in the past to hasten ones
descent on the ladder of morality.  For example, unscrupulous traders
wanting to "burn" their positive alignment could jettison innocent
colonists into the void.  While this is acceptable on occasion, we have
attempted to limit it to once per day.  Likewise, trying to hack into a
corporation can have a negative effect on ones alignment.  It too has been
limited to a once-per-day event.  Loop-holes that have allowed players to
excessively engage in these and other similarly asocial behaviors have been
closed.

                                  -------

                                                                           10

                          Improved TEDIT Prompting

The TEDIT prompts have been enhanced to include not only the default, but
the maximum and minimum acceptable values.  From any prompt, pressing ENTER
without supplying a value returns the default (shown in brackets), as
always.  In addition, pressing the "<" or ">" keys will return the minimum
or maximum values respectively (shown in parenthesis).  For example, when
entering credits for a user, you will see a prompt like this:

     ... credits (0 to 999,999,999) [600] : _

In brackets you see the current amount of credits owned by the player.
Pressing ENTER will leave this value unchanged.  The range of acceptable
values is 0 to 999,999,999, as seen in parenthesis.  Pressing the "<" will
assign a value of 0, and ">" a value of 999,999,999.  For simplicity, these
keys can be used without the SHIFT as "," and ".".

                                  -------

                         Various Code Optimizations

Here are a few of the important optimizations of Trade Wars 2002 v3:

     All of the new code is object oriented, and the most important
     processes have been written in 32 bit assembly language, including all
     file accesses and record searches.

     The game's idle loop has been limited to a few reads and writes per
     second.

     The game's executable and overlay size has been cut significantly by
     pulling all text from the game into a string table.  In a text based
     game, this makes quite a difference.

                                                                           11
