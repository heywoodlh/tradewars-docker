The Merchant Freighter is the ideal ship for those traders that do not want
to concern themselves with political matters.  It is not a very powerful
ship in combat, but its strengths are many.  This ship can carry a large
number of shields and manages to outdistance most ships.  After all, "Those
who fight and run away, live to fight another day" still holds very true in
the universe as we know it today.
