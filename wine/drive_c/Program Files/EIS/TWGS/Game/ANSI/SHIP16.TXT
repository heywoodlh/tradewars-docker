A recently designed vessel, the Interdictor Cruiser is fast becoming
the great Equalizer of the Universe.  It is as powerful as it is large
and packs a tremendous punch in modern combat.  Unfortunately it cannot
use a TransWarp drive due to its size and its speed is not a great asset.
The major attraction of this vessel is the Interdictor Generator that
creates such a large gravity well that no other ship in its sector can
warp out!  When an Interdictor Cruiser arrives on the scene you had
better give up all thoughts of running away. In addition this ship is not
an atmospheric craft and cannot land on any planets.
