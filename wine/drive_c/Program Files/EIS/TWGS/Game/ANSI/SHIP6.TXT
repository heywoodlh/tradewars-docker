The Colonial Transport is a massive structure that can only barely be
called a ship.  This huge craft is ideal for moving large amounts of
products or colonists from place to place.  Though it has a standard
drive, this ship is rather slow due to the mass involved.  Also, the
combat computers are rather limited on this craft due to the excessive
needs of the navigation computers.  The Transport is not outfitted for
carrying or deploying mines.  Conflict brings the Transport's major
weakness to light.  Due to the size of the craft, it is very hard to
defend against fighters.
