Few words can actually describe the sheer awe associated with a
Corporate Flagship.  Only available to Corp CEOs, this huge craft is
the ultimate in power and capability.  Not only can it carry up to
20,000 fighters at one time, this ship carries a powerful combination
of options that will make any foe turn tail and run.

The most impressive capability of the Flagship is the TransWarp Drive.
This device enables the ship to TransWarp to any other sector in the
Universe provided one of your fighters is already there emitting a
locator beam.  Without this, a ship can disapear into TransWarp and
never be seen again.
