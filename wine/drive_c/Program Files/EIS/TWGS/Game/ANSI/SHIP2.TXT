The Scout Marauder is currently the fastest, conventional drive ship
known to mankind.  This small speedster can easily outdistance even the
powerful Corellian Battleships.  It is not equipped for controlling many
fighters or shields, but it fights at 2 to 1 odds due to its quickness
and small size.  This craft cannot carry mines or Genesis Torpedoes.
It may be small, but this ship's speed and range make up for much.
