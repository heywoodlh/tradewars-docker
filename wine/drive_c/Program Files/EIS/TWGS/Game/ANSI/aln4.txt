This is truly the most mysterious alien craft ever discovered.  Efforts to
enter the vessel have remained fruitless, but HoloScans show that the
interior is made up of honeycombed cells, with no one cell resembling any
other in size or shape.  There is no apparent drive mechanism or weaponry,
and the hull is composed of a material never before seen in the known
universe.  This ship was discovered in the heart of the Gwailor Array by
the USS Intrepid, but actual locations and dates are still classified.
