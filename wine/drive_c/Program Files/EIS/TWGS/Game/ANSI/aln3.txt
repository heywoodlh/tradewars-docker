Responding to a beacon repeating the phrase "man...man...man", a passing
scout ship discovered this heavily damaged vessel near the outer rim of
the known trading lanes.  Two lifeforms were found in an active stasis
chamber in one of the few compartments not ruptured by whatever destroyed
most of this ship, but efforts to revive the aliens failed.  Analysis of
the bodies showed them to be small bi-peds (45 cm in height) with large
brain cases and mirrored organs.  Additional lifeform data is classified.
