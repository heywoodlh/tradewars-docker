One of these warships was recently sighted off the Antarian Nebulae.  This
craft was unknown to the Federation until a hapless materials transport warping
from the StarDock to a Federation Outpost was set upon by a pair of these.  The
crew managed to return the above info before contact was lost with them.  From
the debris left in the area, it would appear that these ships pack a powerful
punch.  No escape pod made if off the 'Sport to provide further details.
