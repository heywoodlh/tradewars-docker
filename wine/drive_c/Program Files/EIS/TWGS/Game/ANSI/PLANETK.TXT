Thin Oxygen/Nitrogen atmosphere.  Specific gravity within 0.5 to 1.5 Earth
normal.  Weather patterns are mostly dry and hot with temperatures ranging
fron 40 to 140 degrees Celsius.  Little area of fertile soil, very bad for
Organics.  Very little precious metal making it bad for Equipment production.
Common Chemical traces making it great for Fuel Ore.  Class K worlds are
average for humanoid colonization but an arrid and hot climate requires
specialized colonists.  Narrow habitability band but a generally stable
