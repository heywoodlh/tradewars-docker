The Ferrengi Scorpion is a new class of ship recently sighted near the
outpost of Rylos.  Although only one is known to exist, this extremely
dangerous ship appears resistant to almost all Federation technology.  All
commissioned Captains and civilians are advised not to engage these craft until
further research has been completed.
