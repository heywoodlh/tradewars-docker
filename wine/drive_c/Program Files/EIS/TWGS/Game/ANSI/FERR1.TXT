This craft has been identified as the Ferrengi's primary scouting vessel.
It does carry sufficient firepower to pose a threat to some of the smaller
Federation-design warcraft though.  The Ferrengi seem to excel in developing
drive systems and the Assault Trader makes this readily apparent in its high
speed and agility.  One craft by it's self can be handled, but be warned that
they prefer to travel in convoys.
