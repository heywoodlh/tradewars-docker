"Big, slow and ugly...", seem to be the words most often overheard when
someone is describing the Taurean Mule.  Designed in direct competition
with the CargoTran, the Mule is somewhat faster and possesses a higher
cargo capacity, but it is even more vulnerable to piracy and attack than
it's competitor.  However, this is still a good ship for traders who have
staked out "safe" trade lanes and do not have to worry about enemy attacks.
