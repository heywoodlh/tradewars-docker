The Constellation is the direct offspring of the Correlian Battleship.
While not quite as powerful as its distinguished parent, the Constellation
makes its own mark with greater speed and range.  Traders have dubbed it
the "baby battleship", but this "infant" is one of the most powerful and
maneuverable ships available in the universe today.
