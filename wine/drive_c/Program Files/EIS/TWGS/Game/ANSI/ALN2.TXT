Found in the outer reaches of the Auerlia system, this enormous spherical
craft may hold the key to future technological innovations.  It's hull is
composed of pure Aneterium, an incredibly dense tracyt-molecular compound
that Federation scientists began experimenting with only a few years ago.
The propulsion system is an advanced version of the experimental IonPulse
drive, under development by Markham Industries.  No life forms or weapons
were discovered on board.  This ship's origins are still unknown.
