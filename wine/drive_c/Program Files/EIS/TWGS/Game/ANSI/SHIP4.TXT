The Corellian Battleship is a dangerous craft indeed!  This ship packs
the most punch of any ship in the Federation.  Battleship's can carry
four times the fighters of a Merchant and deliver them with a much
higher degree of effectiveness due to their superior combat computers.
The shield generators on Battleships are capable of shielding the ship's
fighters as well.  This craft is one of the more prestigious and powerful
ships available today.
