The remains of this powerful looking craft were discovered in the Slogovian
Estates Nebulae.  The Derelict was located due to extremely high Tau-Chi
radiation emmisions.  The craft has been under study for years now but it is
difficult to collect data since no space craft can safely venture within 12
parsecs of the wreckage.  Please note the location of this ship on your star
charts and give the area wide berth.
