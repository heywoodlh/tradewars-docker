The commercial version of a Federation StarShip is not available to just
anyone.  This craft is only available to those who are commissioned by the
Federation to aid in their cause.  StarShips are the most closely guarded
technology in existence.  They can carry massive assault power and through
the use of the TransWarp drive, they can deliver this power almost anywhere.

The Imperial StarShip is truly the most powerful ship that a private
individual can command.  More information about qualifying for a Federal
commission is available at a Police station near you.
