The CargoTran is a large ship indeed.  Though not as fast as some of its
related trading cousins, this ship can move vast amounts of goods.  It is
typically a pacifist's ship as it does not carry much in the way of
offensive capabilities but it's very large array of holds makes up for all
of that.  The large shield capacity of this craft makes it safe to wander
hostile territory as well.  This ship is considered by many to be one of
the top money-makers in the Universe.
