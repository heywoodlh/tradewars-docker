The Havoc Gunstar is a recently developed ship that owes its existance to
new developments in micro-miniaturization.  This mid-sized ship is the only
one of its size to be able to house a TransWarp drive.  Though it doesn't
carry a large amount of holds to fuel the TransWarp, it still has a decent
T-Warp range and can arrive at its destination packing a moderate fighting
force in the bargain.  Watch for this ship to become the favorite of the
Mercenary legions in the Universe.
