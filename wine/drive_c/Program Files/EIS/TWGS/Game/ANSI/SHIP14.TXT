Young corporations in need of planetary defense should consider the
Sentinel.  With its new planetary combat guidance system, this ship's
normal combat odds of 1:1 shoot up to 4:1 when defending a corporate
planet.  When an enemy ship enters a sector containing a Sentinel set in
defense of a corporate planet, the hostile vessel must first destroy the
Sentinel and all of its fighters before it may land and attempt any action
toward the planet.  Remember:  The Sentinel was designed primarily for
Planetary defense, if used for offensive purposes its combat odds are 1:1.
