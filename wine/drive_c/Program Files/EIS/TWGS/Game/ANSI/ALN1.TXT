The first unidentified alien derelict was found in the year 2000 in the heart
of the Evander star cluster.  A passing merchant cruiser noticed a
gravitational anomaly eminating from a dead planet in the cluster.  After
stopping to investigate it discovered the alien craft, almost ten times
larger than a Corellian BattleShip, in a decaying orbit around the dead
planet.  FedSpace authorities towed the ship back to Sol, but ongoing
investigations have revealed little about this strange, beautiful vessel.
