Thin Oxygen/Nitrogen atmosphere.  Specific gravity within 1.0 to 2.2 Earth
normal.  Weather patterns are wet with temperatures ranging anywhere from
-30 to 50 Celsius depending on the width of the habitability band.  Excellent
Mineral and Ore deposits but harsh conditions only permit avg to below avg
Equipment production.  Soil is excellent, providing higher than normal
organics production.  Colonist specialization is necessary to maintain
population.  Good - very good population harmony quotient.  Above average
"habitability band" but only medium population growth.  Drawbacks include
hazards to equipment and occasional severe weather conditions.
