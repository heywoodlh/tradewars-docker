The U.S.S. Constellation was destroyed recently when it was engaged by this
new class of Ferrengi vessel.  The craft dropped out of a cloaked mode and
attacked the Constellation before they even had a chance to raise their shields
or return fire.  All commissioned StarShip Captains have been notified that the
appearance of one of these weapons of Destruction is a Priority Red demand for
assistance.  Civilians with appropriate defenses have also been asked to aid in
the defense against these powerful ships.
