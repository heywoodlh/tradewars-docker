                               Introduction

Trade Wars 2002 Gold Edition is an expansion for standard Trade Wars and
adds the ability to create custom ships, planets, and non-players.


                                 Overview

Three new editors are included in the Gold Edition of TEDIT.  With these
editors you will be free to customize all standard ship, planet, and alien
types and to create your own.

Ship Editor

  All standard ship options are available and can be enabled or disabled
  for each new ship.  These include TransWarp, Interdictor, Combat
  Scanner, Planet Scanner, Holographic Scanner, Imperial, CEO, etc.  New
  ship options have been added as well, including Fusion Drive System,
  Escape Pod type, Corporate, Unique, etc.  Equipment maximums are
  completely configurable.  Combat odds have been split into offensive and
  defensive.  Ship costs are projected based on physical characteristics
  of each ship, and can be overridden to any value.  Ships are rated based
  on physical characteristics under four basic categories:  Combat, Cargo,
  Transport, Scout.

  Ships will be deployed into the game as General, Alien, or Manual.
  General ships are available at StarDock and their information displays
  will be available in the computer's ships database.  Alien ships are
  piloted by a target race, and players gain access to these ships by
  defeating the alien and capturing the ship.  The information displays
  for these ships will be available in the StarDock library under the
  given alien race.  Manual ships are to be placed into the game by the
  sysop using TEDIT.  These will be the source of special quests.  The
  information displays for these ships will be available in the StarDock
  library under Miscellaneous Spacecraft.

Planet Editor

  The Planet Editor includes a planet construction mode that allows you to
  create a planet based on several physical attributes:  Geological
  Activity, Temperature, Hydrosphere, Terrain, Atmosphere, Gravity, and
  Weather.  These determine the class-subclass of the planet, and all
  planetary parameters are set according to the chosen conditions.  You
  will then have complete access to all parameters and will be free to set
  them to any value.

  Planets will be deployed similarly to ships as General, Alien and
  Manual. General planets are available to players when they start the
  game or when they use a Genesis Torpedo.  The descriptions of these
  planets will be available in the computer's planets database.  Alien
  planets will be the homeworld of the target alien race.  Only enhanced
  aliens will have homeworlds since basic alien AI makes no use of
  planets.  The descriptions of these planets will be available in the
  StarDock library under the given alien race.  Manual planets are to be
  placed into the game by the sysop using TEDIT.  These will be the source
  of special quests.  The information displays for these planets will be
  available in the StarDock library under Miscellaneous Planets.

                                                                            3

Non-player Editor

  There are two categories of Gold aliens: basic and enhanced.

  Basic aliens behave much like the standard Alien Traders, but they can
  be customized to be very distinct.  They can have their own naming
  style, rankings for good and evil, and they can fly their own custom
  ship types. You can customize their spawning parameters to make them as
  weak or as powerful as you wish.  You can even create "unique" ships to
  be flown by single "unique" aliens.  Experiment with these basic aliens
  using the TEDIT Gold Alien Editor.  There is extensive online help
  available to guide you, and there are sample files in the Gold
  subdirectory to familiarize you with the creation of name and rank
  files.

Non-player Server

  Trade Wars Gold aliens are not processed internally by each active game
  session.  Instead, each alien race is processed by a devoted "non-player
  server".  The server handles the spawning and movement of the aliens by
  interacting with the game and players through the data files and with
  game event messages.  Using special "AI Modules", the server can respond
  to many game events in very complex ways giving Gold aliens much more
  depth and variety.

Gold Development Kit

  The Gold Development Kit is needed to create the AI modules used by the
  enhanced Gold aliens.  With this kit, aliens can be made to react to all
  events that players receive (player enters sector, exits sector, lands
  on planet, etc.).  In developing the AI for aliens, the developer will
  simply write the event handlers for these events.  We've included a
  group of specialized functions to simplify certain processes, but we've
  also included a generalized interface to all data files within the game.
  There should be no limit to what enhanced aliens can do.

  NOTE:  The AI module feature has been put on hold while bugs in the game
  are addressed.  After these problems have been solved, the AI module
  feature will be released.

You can enable the Trade Wars Gold extensions from any standard Trade Wars
v3.06+ by purchasing a Gold registration key for $25 from EIS.

                         ------------------------


                               Ship Ratings

Each ship is analyzed and assigned a rating in each of four categories:
Combat, Cargo, Transport, and Scout.

Combat ships are those that excel in both defensive and offensive
maneuvers.  Agility is important, as is sheer fighter strength.

Cargo and Transport ships are very similar.  Each depends heavily on a
large cargo capacity.  Better cargo ships have decent defensive
capabilities as these ships are often used in the unprotected areas of the
Trade Wars universe.  Transports don't require strong defensive
capabilities as they are generally used to move colonists along protected
space routes.  The primary goal of a Transport is the moving of colonists
from planet to planet, so the ability to enter an atmosphere is critical
for these ships.

Scout ships are those ships used for various other tasks in Trade Wars.  In
order to handle such activities as scouting for stocked ports and other
points of interest, the scout ship must be well equipped with sensing
equipment.  Other duties include creation of planets, destruction of
planets, release of marker beacons, etc., and a ship's capacity for carrying
the equipment needed for these maneuvers is an important factor.  Agility
and defensive capability are also important.

These ship ratings are used primarily by the alien server when determining
what ships an alien race will have access to at any given time.  You will
be able to limit your alien races to less powerful ships at the beginning
of a game, and let them "grow" into more powerful ships as the game goes on.

Different races will have preference for ships of different categories, so
you will be able to specify the "timeline" for alien ships for each of the
four categories.

                                  -------

                            Ship Class and Make

You can specify the class and make of each ship.  You have complete control
over color formatting for these fields.  The make can be "Standard
Manufacture" which means that each new instance of a ship will be randomly
assigned a common Trade Wars manufacturer.  You can also specify a custom
manufacturer.

                                 --------

                              Maximum Values

This screen sets the maximum capacities allowed for the equipment that a
given ship can carry.  Available fields are:

  Cargo Holds           Atomic Detonators
  Fighters              Corbomite Devices
  Shields               SubSpace Ether Probes
  Armid/Limpet Mines    Mine Disruptors
  Marker Beacons        Photon Missiles
  Genesis Torpedoes     Fighter Attack Force
  Cloaking Devices

                                                                            5
Fighter Attack Force is the maximum number of fighters that the ship can
launch into a single attack during combat.

                                 --------

                              Initial Values

This screen has the initial settings for values that could change over the
life of the ship.  Available fields are:

  Number of holds             Transporter range
  Turns to warp one sector    Rank required for commission
  Offensive combat odds       Defensive combat odds

Offensive combat odds are used when a player is the aggressor in a combat.
This includes attacking defensive sector fighters, defensive planetary
fighters, and initiating an attack against a player or alien.

Defensive combat odds are used when a player is the victim in a combat.
This includes being attacked by offensive sector fighters, offensive
planetary fighters, and by a player or alien.

                                 --------

                                 Settings

These are options that can be made available for a ship as well as flags
that define certain behaviors for the ship.  Fields include:

  Allow Density Scanner          Can land on a planet
  Allow Holographic Scanner      Defensive guardian bonus
  Allow TransWarp Drive          Fusion drive system
  Allow Planet Scanner           Allow players to swap ships
  Allow Interdictor Generator    Require Imperial commission
  Allow Combat Scanner           Require corporate status
  Used as Escape Pod             Require CEO status
                                 Carries Escape Pod
                                 Escape Pod

The fusion drive system is an improvement over the common atomic fission
drives used in lower-priced craft.  Engine stresses are greatly reduced,
and the result is typically a much higher resale value.

If a ship has been flagged as an Escape Pod, it can be assigned to another
ship as that ship's Escape Pod type.  Escape Pods cannot carry Escape Pods
themselves.

                                  -------

                                   Costs

Each ship has four basic costs associated with it:  Hold Space, Drive
System, Computer System, and Ship's Hull.  These are projected for each
ship based on the parameters specified for that ship.  You will have
complete control over each of the four basic costs, but you will be
notified of the amount of discrepancy between the recommended and the
specified cost.

                               Miscellaneous

The miscellaneous menu is used to determine how the ship is deployed in the
game.  Available options are:

  Deployment method
  Target race
  Functional
  Unique
  Available
  ANSI illustration
  Text description
  Ship is active

Deployment method is General, Alien, or Manual.  For Alien, target race is
the race that will pilot the ship in the game.  For Alien and Manual,
functional determines whether players will be able to use the ship once it
is captured.  Also for Alien and Manual, unique determines whether a single
instance of the ship can exist in the game at any given time.  For unique
ships, available determines whether the ship is currently available for
use.

The ANSI and text description files can be created for each ship.  These
fields specify the name of these files.  These descriptions will be
displayed in either the computer's ships display, or the StarDock library.

Up to 65000 ships can be stored in the Gold ship database, but only 1000
can be active in the game.  Use the "ship is active" field to enable or
disable the ship.

                                   Title

You can specify the title for each planet.  You have complete control over
color formatting for this field.

                                 --------

                            Class and Subclass

The class and subclass IDs are determined by the physical characteristics
specified in the planet attribute menu.  This menu offers these categories
and ranges:

  Geological Activity

    Dead
    Dormant
    Normal
    Active
    Violent

  Temperature

    Searing
    Hot
    Normal

    Low
    Normal
    Heavy
    Crushing

  Weather

    Stagnant

    Normal
    Turbulent
    Chaotic

Normal is determined relative to Earth type planets.

Each attribute range outside of normal will result in a modification of the
planetary parameters from the Earth normal.  Multiple non-normal attributes
will result in a cumulative modification of these parameters.

You will be allowed to adjust each planetary parameter individually after
these initial values are set.

                                 --------

                              Maximum Values

This screen sets the maximum capacities allowed for the various planetary
parameters.  Available fields are:

  Colonists producing fuel ore
  Colonists producing organics
  Colonists producing equipment
  Storage capacity for fuel ore
  Storage capacity for organics
  Storage capacity for equipment
  Storage capacity for fighters
  Storage capacity for shields
  Citadel technology level

The Citadel technology level is the maximum level that a Citadel can be
constructed to on this planet.

                                 --------

                              Initial Values

This screen has the initial settings for values that could change over the
life of the planet.  Available fields are:

  Colonists to produce one fuel unit
  Colonists to produce one organic unit
  Colonists to produce one equipment unit
  Colonists to produce one fighter unit
  Starting fuel ore
  Starting organics
  Starting equipment
  Hazard level
  Habitability rating

The habitability rating determines how frequent natural disasters occur on
the planet, and the hazard level determines how extreme the losses from
these disasters will be.

                                                                            9
                              Citadel Values

Use this menu to set the requirements for advancement of a Citadel to each
new level.  The levels of advancement are:

  Unarmed
  Armed
  Quasar
  TransWarp
  Shields
  Interdictor


The requirements for these levels are

  Fuel ore
  Organics
  Equipment
  Days
  Colonists

                                  -------

                               Miscellaneous

The miscellaneous menu is used to determine how the planet is deployed in
the game.  Available options are:

  Deployment method
  Target race
  ANSI illustration
  Text description
  Planet is active

Deployment method is General, Alien, or Manual.  For Alien, target race is
the enhanced race that will occupy the planet in the game.

The ANSI and text description files can be created for each planet.  These
fields specify the name of these files.  These descriptions will be
displayed in either the computer's planets display, or the StarDock
library.

Up to 65000 planets can be stored in the Gold planet database, but only
1000 can be active in the game.  Use the "planet is active" field to enable
or disable the planet.

                           Race and Alien Titles

You can specify the titles for each race.  These two titles are intended to
describe the race as a whole and an individual of the race respectively.

                                  -------

                            Race Identification

The unique race identifier is generated from the race title and slightly
modified to avoid any collisions with existing races.  This identifier is
used when running the non-player server.

                                 --------

                                 Settings

This menu offers several parameters that determine how the race will
function in the game.  These fields are:

  Days until race appears       Travel in groups?
  Days until full strength      Maximum members of group
  Initial number of aliens      Spawn anomalous aliens?
  Maximum number of aliens      Unforgiving?
  Show alien rank               Regenerate?
  Movement chance
  Organization?
  Xenophobic?
  Protective?

You can specify that this group is an organization rather than an alien
race if you want to create some non-player corporation for example.  The
information about this group will be displayed under "Known Galactic
Organizations" rather than "Known Alien Races" in the StarDock library.

Xenophobic aliens will tend to leave any sector occupied by a player.

If this race travels in groups, then when an alien moves from one sector to
another, he will tend to bring up to the maximum members of the group with him.

If you allow the server to spawn anomalous aliens, there is a 1 percent chance
per spawning event that the alien generated will be more advanced than the other
aliens by from 100 to 200 days.  If the game age is 30 days and an anomalous
alien is generated, it will be generated as if the game age was from 130 days to
230 days.  This will allow more advanced ships to be deployed into the game
earlier, but with a very low probability.

Unforgiving aliens hold grudges against players who destroy members of their
race.  In order for a grudge to occur, a player must destroy the alien in view
of another alien of the same race.  Only 10 players can be place on a grudge
list at any one time, so when new players are added the oldest will drop off.
A grudges manifests itself in three ways.  Any attack by the alien will be
more severe depending on how recent the grudge occurred, aliens will attack
a player when it enters the alien's current sector, and aliens will attack a
player when they enter the player's current sector.

Aliens can regenerate.  Regeneration occurs each time an alien attempts to
move.  The fighters and shields of the alien will regenerate toward the
average value for the current day.  This will allow aliens weakened in combat
to "heal", and aliens spawned earlier in the game or with low fighter and
shield amounts to  grow in strength.

                                 --------

                             Spawning Profile

When an alien is spawned, several equations are used to determine its
starting attributes and ship equipment.  You have control over the form of
these equations.  The spawned fields are:

  Fighters
  Shields
  Holds
  Alignment
  Experience
  Corbomite
  Credits

There are six basic forms, and a custom equation option will be available
in future revisions.  Each equation uses one or more of the following:  two
variables, T (age of game in days), and X (spawned experience), and three
constants, A, B, and C.  These constants can be set to a range of positive
and negative values to effect the result of each equation.

Many equations use a random distribution function r(N), defined as a random
value between 0 and N.  Therefore, the actual spawned value for each field
is somewhere between a maximum and minimum value that depends on the values
of the variables and constants.

The main screen displays the maximum (or minimum) value for each field for the
start and the full-strength days of this race.  This is the value that would
occur if each r(N) in the equation returned N.  The display also shows the
average value returned on these days as determined by a statistical analysis
of 1000 spawning events.

You can select any of the fields to open the Spawning Equation Editor.  This
screen allows you to modify the form of the equation and to set the values for
the variables.  You are also shown a more detailed report of the behavior of
the chosen equation.  You can specify the day that the report should sample.
The values shown are the maximum (r(N)=N), minimum (r(N)=0), and the threshold
values associated with 99%, 90%, 75%, 50%, 25%, 10%, and 1% of the spawned
aliens.  These percent thresholds are determined from a sample of 1000 spawning
events, and project the probability that the field for aliens generated on
this day will be given a value greater than or equal to the associated
threshold.

You can modify the parameters of an equation and study the sampling report to
determine the effects.  Using this feedback, you should be able to tailor the
spawning profile to fit your needs.

                                                                            11
                                 Resources

This menu determines what resources (ships and planets) the alien race will
have access to.

  Ship and Planet Deployments

    The race can be given access to ships and planets of General and
    Alien deployment.  They can also be given access to specifically
    chosen ships and planets regardless of the ship's or planet's
    deployment method.

  Days Before Ship Is Accessible

    This table determines which ship rating levels (Combat, Cargo,
    Transport, Scout, levels I-IV) that an individual alien will have
    access to based on the age of the game and the experience of the
    spawned alien.

    A day is assigned to each ship rating level.  This day determines at
    what point the ship becomes accessible to that alien race.  It does
    not mean that the ship will be accessible to a given alien once that
    day has arrived.  The experience generated for an alien is typically
    a random value between a minimum and maximum value.  On the specified
    day, the maximum value possible for the spawned experience is used as
    the experience threshold when determining who has access to a ship of
    that level.

    As an example, if a Cargo IV is made accessible to a race on day 120,
    then the experience threshold for a Cargo IV is determined to be the
    maximum possible experience on that day.  If the experience equation
    was a simple r(T), meaning a random number between 0 and the game
    age, then the maximum experience for day 120 would be 120.
    Therefore, an alien spawned on that day with 120 (a rare occurrence)
    would have access to this ship.  At day 240, there will be a 50%
    probability that an alien will have access to a ship of this level.
    You will see no ships of this level before 120 days, very few at 120
    and just after, and increasingly many as the days progress above 120.

    An alien will show a preference to the highest level ships available
    to it, but it is possible for the most powerful of aliens to fly the
    weakest of ships.

  Sample Available Ships

    This is an important tool to demonstrate what ships your aliens will have
    available in a game and at what point the ships are likely to be deployed.
    You can determine when a ship can first appear, when it is more likely to
    appear, and when it will be common.  You should use this report along with
    the "days before ship is accessible" values to create a ship deployment
    timeline.

                                 --------

                                 Rankings

Standard Trade Wars offers two tables for player and alien rankings, one
for good and one for evil alignments.  Gold allows you to create your own
ranking tables and assign them to your new aliens.  This screen offers
these fields:

  Good rank file
  Evil rank file
  Highest rank at
  View good ranks
  View evil ranks

Rank files are simply ASCII lists with each rank on a separate line going
from lowest to highest.  There are samples of ranking files in the GOLD
subdirectory showing the default good and evil ranks, as well as custom
Ferrengi rankings.

                                                                            12
The "highest rank at" field is used to determine at what day aliens of the
maximum rank will begin to appear.  Similar to the ship level tables under
Resources, the ranking function sets the experience threshold for the
highest rank to be the maximum possible spawnable experience for the day
specified in this field.  The rest of the rank levels are assigned
experience thresholds based on an exponential progression determined by the
maximum level and the number of ranking levels.

You can sample your ranking tables using the "view good ranks" and "view
evil ranks" options.

                               Miscellaneous

This menu offers miscellaneous options used to incorporate the aliens into
the game.  Available options are:

  AI module file
  Alien name file
  Sample alien names
  Ship name file
  Sample ship names
  ANSI illustration
  Text description
  Race is active

The AI module file is the brains of the enhanced aliens.  These modules can
be created with a special development kit that will be released by EIS.

  NOTE:  The AI module feature has been put on hold while bugs in the game
  are addressed.  After these problems have been solved, the AI module
  feature will be released.


The alien and ship name files use a special name generator that reads a
name description file (extension .NAM).  There are samples of these files
in the GOLD directory showing the variety of ways that names can be
generated.  See the NONPNAME.DOC document for further information about
creating name description files.

You can view several samples generated with the selected name description
file using the "sample names" options.

The ANSI and text description files can be created for each alien race.
These fields specify the name of these files.  These descriptions will be
displayed in the StarDock library.

Up to 65000 races can be stored in the Gold alien race database, but only
100 races or 1000 individual aliens can be active in the game.  Use the
"Race is active" field to enable or disable the race.

                         ------------------------
                             Non-player Server
                         ------------------------


                            Running the Server

Step one is deciding what race you would like to begin processing.  You
must activate this alien race under Miscellaneous in the Gold Alien Editor
of TEDIT.  Also make sure that any ships that your aliens will have access
to are active, and that any unique ships are available.  Test the name and
rank generations to see that everything is in order.  If you'd like to see
aliens immediately in a new game, set the initial number of aliens to
something greater than 0 under Settings in the Gold Alien Editor.  If you'd
like to see how the aliens appear in a more advanced game, set the game age
to a higher number of days in the TEDIT General Editor One.  When
everything checks out, you are ready to begin processing your new alien in
a live Trade Wars game.

Each alien has a unique identification string which you can find on the
Settings screen of the Gold Alien Editor.  For example, the ID string for
Alien Traders is ALIENTRADERS.  This ID is generated from the name of the
race, and is modified slightly to avoid collisions with existing races.

To start the server, type NONPSERV [ALIEN ID] from the game directory.  In
the case of the Alien Traders, this will be NONPSERV ALIENTRADERS.  The
server will report any problems that it encounters, and if all is well you
will see the server status screen.

Note that you do not need an active game session to run the alien server.
You can allow your aliens to continue their activities even when there are
no players online.  This will be more useful with enhanced aliens.  You can
set the alien race to discontinue processing until an active player is in
the game.  This setting is under TEDIT General Editor Two.

                                 --------

                           Server Status Screen

If your game age is higher than the starting day for this race, you should
begin to see alien spawning events.  These events will display the basic
characteristics of the aliens.  Another event that you will see immediately
is the move event.  These demonstrate how the server status screen
functions.  You will also notice the spinning "working" indicator in the
upper left corner.  This is meant to convey that the server is functioning
normally even if very little or no activity is seen.  At the bottom is the
number of active aliens, maximum number of aliens, time, and number of
events.  The number of active aliens is the number that should be active on
that day.  As aliens are killed and respawned, the actual number will vary
but only for a few moments.  The maximum number of aliens indicates the
maximum that you specified in the Gold Alien Editor Settings menu.  The
time and number of events are tallied from activation of the server and
indicate the seconds that have elapsed and the number of events that have
occurred respectively.

When a player is active in the game, you will begin to see many other
events.  These are messages reporting what the alien in a given sector is
"aware" of.  These are the events that the enhanced aliens will be able to
react to with an AI Module installed.  For example, a basic alien will
report that a player has entered its sector, while an enhanced alien could
report the event and then try to extort money from that player as in the
case of the enhanced Ferrengi.

To exit the server and disable all activity of this alien race, press "Q".
The spawned and active aliens will still exist within the game, but they
will be frozen in time.  Since alien combat is handled by the active game
session, they will function normally when attacked.

If you decide to deactivate a race once it has been active in a game, the
aliens will be physically removed from the game.

                           Gold Development Kit
                         ------------------------

Using the Gold Development Kit (GDK), developers can create enhanced aliens
that have the ability to react to multiple game events and interact with
the game and players through a library of standard functions as well as a
generalized data file interface.
