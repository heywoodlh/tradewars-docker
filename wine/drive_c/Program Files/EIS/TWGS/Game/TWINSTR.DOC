Trade Wars 2002 combines adventure and exploration with strategy
and cooperative play in an entertaining and exciting on-line
game.  You compete against other BBSers to be the most powerful
trader (or corporation of traders) in the universe.  Independent
traders can compete quite effectively against large corporations.
Corporate members can perform specific duties (as directed by
their C.E.O.) in specialized ships.  Traders can be "good guys" or
"bad guys" with different avenues for advancement.  The universe
can be different with each new game.  There is no right or wrong
way to play and the possible strategies are limited only by one's
imagination.


PLAYING THE GAME

When you enter the game, you will be piloting a Merchant Cruiser.
This is considered the most versatile ship in the Trade Wars
armada.  In it, new players have a chance to try out all aspects
of the game.

Upon entering, you will be asked what alias you would like to use
in the game and what name you would like to christen your ship.
The alias you choose will display in the player and corporate
rankings and in several corporate listings.  Your ship name will
be used in the docking logs at the ports.  You can use these
names to be as conspicuous or as inconspicuous as you want.
If your sysop has it configured this way, you will also be
given a personal planet when you enter the game.  You will
be asked to name the planet here.  You can then use option
<Y> Your Personal Planets from the Computer Menu to locate
the planet.

The equipment in your initial ship will include some holds to
store the cargo that you can trade at the ports found throughout
the universe.  Trading is the basic way to advance in the game.
By good trading, you can gain experience as well as gain credits.
The credits you earn can fund your military and can provide the
capital you will need to expand your trading expeditions.  You
will have some credits with which you can purchase some
commodities for trading.  You will additionally have some
fighters to offer some protection as you begin your voyage.

The game will differ with each different group of players.
Individual traders are ranked by their experience.  You gain
experience simply by playing the game.  The more things you do,
the more experience you will get.  Good and Evil are represented
by the titles each player receives.  Your experience combined
with your alignment will determine whether you are a Lieutenant
or a Dread Pirate.  When you do something that affects your
alignment, you will get a message saying your alignment went up
or down and by how much.

There are benefits and drawbacks whether you choose to play the
game as a good trader or an evil trader.  Traders who follow the
FedLaws are offered protection in FedSpace until they are
experienced enough to protect themselves.  Traders who aspire to
be very good can be awarded a Federal Commission.  This allows
them to purchase an Imperial Starship.  This is one of the most
powerful ships in the universe.  On the other hand, the evil
traders are offered some options in the Underground.  Traders who
have proved that they are truly evil can steal product or money
from the ports.

THE UNIVERSE

You will be traveling in a universe, whose size was determined by
your SysOp.  Sectors may have planets, ports, other players,
empty ships, aliens, Ferrengi, Federation Starships, mines,
message beacons, fighters (belonging to you, other players, rogue
mercenaries, or the Ferrengi) or the sectors may contain nothing
at all.  If in your travels you come across something
undesirable, your initial ship comes equipped with 30
fighters with which you can defend yourself.

Many players find it useful to have a home sector or group of
sectors.  Players, especially those just joining a game, need an
out-of-the-way place to stay so they can build up their assets.
You can explore the universe and look for dead end sectors to use
as a hiding place.  Corporate bases built in traffic lanes do not
fare too well and those in the major thoroughfares (in the paths
between the class 0 and class 9 ports) just do not stand much of
a chance.

Planets play a key part in your success as a trader.  Terra, the
first planet you encounter as you enter the game, is where the
people can be found to colonize all other planets.  Remember, the
environment on some planet types may be hazardous to humans.  The
other planets in the game will, if inhabited, produce Fuel Ore,
Organics, Equipment and Fighters.  The amounts of these
commodities produced will be affected by the type of planet.  For
example, a Mountainous planet will provide more Fuel Ore than an
Oceanic planet.  You and the other traders decide where the
planets will be.  You can purchase a Genesis Torpedo and use it
in almost any sector in the galaxy.  If the planet has enough of
the required commodities and enough people to supply the labor to
build it, you can begin construction of a Citadel.  The Citadel
can provide you and the other members of your corporation with a
secure place to dock your ships and deposit the credits you've
earned.  As you progress in the game, your Citadel can be
upgraded to provide additional protection to you and your
corporation.  If you decide to build a planet in your home
sector, be sure you can defend it.  A planet is very vulnerable
until it has a Combat Control Computer (level 2 Citadel) to
safeguard it.

There are ten different types of ports scattered about the
universe.  The ports are classified by the products they buy
and/or sell.  Port classes 1 through 8 trade the three basic
commodities: Fuel Ore, Organics and Equipment.  The universe also
contains specialty ports for the other items you will need to
advance in the game.  There are three Class 0 ports where you can
purchase holds (beneficial for moving colonists to your planets
as well as transporting goods for trade), fighters (to help
protect your territory), or shields (to protect your ship from
the traps laid by your enemies).  %GMK%There is one Class 9 port
that contains not only a Trading Port, but also a StarDock.  The
StarDock houses the Stellar Hardware Emporium, the Federation
Shipyards, the Lost Trader's Tavern, the 2nd National Galactic
Bank, the Videon Cineplex and the Interstellar Space Police
Headquarters.  There are other places of interest located in the
StarDock.  These places you will have to discover on your own.
Some are not advertised because they are establishments of
questionable repute.  Others are Federation buildings that house
top secret government information.


PEOPLE IN THE TRADE WARS UNIVERSE

A large part of playing is interacting with others in the game.
You can mingle with other players in the Lost Traders Tavern,
gambling against them, conversing with them, leaving
announcements at the door or writing a message on the bathroom
wall.  You can combine your assets with other players of the same
alignment to form a Corporation.  Just be aware that more than
one Corporation has been brought down by a con man who wormed his
way into the Corporate structure.  You can have a chance
encounter with other creatures of the universe, both real (other
users) and Non-Player Characters (the Federals, Alien traders and
the Ferrengi).  Chance encounters offer many possibilities and
can advance you in your chosen career path.  Your alignment and
experience and the alignment and experience of the creature you
encounter will determine just how that advancement if affected.

Other traders are users just like you.  They have alignment and
experience points.  You can see all the others by Listing Traders
from your ships computer.  By using the listing, you can see
which players are good and which are evil.  You can estimate
whether the other player would better serve your needs as an ally
or adversary.

The Federation is the main governing body of the cosmos.  You
will meet the Feds if you go to the Police Station.  You might
run into them as you roam around space.  The Feds don't look
kindly on players who break FedLaws, so if you're not careful,
they might visit you when you least want their company.

Alien traders are visitors from another universe who are looking
for better ports.  You can get a listing of the Aliens similar to
the one you get for other traders.  Aliens also have experience
and alignment, but you cannot form a Corporation with them.

The Ferrengi are a greedy, cowardly group.  Their primary purpose
is the speedy acquisition of money.  They will steal from anyone
no matter what the person's or corporation's alignment.  They
seldom engage in face-to-face combat because they prefer the
advantage of surprise when ambushing their opponent.  They often
travel in groups and will spy on promising territory.  After
targeting an area, they will raid the sector when it is least
defended.  If they are attacked, that group will hold a grudge
against the attacker and they will not rest until they feel the
score has been settled.

Explore the universe and take part in the adventure.  You can
just look around or you can become a dominant factor.  Most of
the displays are fully explained.  When you are asked to make a
selection, anything displayed in brackets [], will be the
default.

Most displays can be aborted by hitting the space bar.

Good Trading and Good Luck.


                          MENU OPTIONS

MAIN MENU

Navigation

<D>  Re-display Sector.  This will re-display the information
     about the sector where you are currently located.
     Information includes sector number and nebulae name,
     marker beacons, port name and class, mines, fighters,
     planets and any other ships.  Next to the class you will see
     three letters signifying how the port trades in the
     commodities.  For example a SSB would indicate that the port
     sells Fuel Ore, sells Organics and buys Equipment.  The
     adjacent sectors will also be shown.  With a color display,
     the sectors you have not yet visited will show up in red.

<P>  Port and Trade.  This will allow you to dock at the port
     in your current sector.  This is the only way to trade
     your commodities.  You will have some choices for what
     action you would like to take at the port.  Most of the
     choices are self-explanatory.  If you are playing the game
     as an evil trader, the choices you see will be different than
     they would be if you were playing the game as a lawful Player.
     When you dock at the port, you will be able to see the docking
     log.  This will show you the name of the last ship to do business
     there.  If there is a planet in the sector with this port, you
     will be able to negotiate a Planetary Trade Agreement.  This is a
     trade contract that will allow you to trade off all your excess
     commodities to the port without wasting your turns hauling one
     shipload at a time.  If you want to build a new Starport and the
     universe is full or if you decide that your adversaries have too
     big an advantage and you need to get rid of that port they have
     been using, you can attack and destroy a starport.  This is never
     an easy task.  The starports are very heavily armed and will
     retaliate, so you will need to have plenty of military forces
     with you if you decide to proceed with this selection.

<M>  Move to a Sector.  The sectors adjacent to your current
     location will be listed as warp lanes in the sector
     display.  You can move to one of them, or you can choose
     any other sector in the universe.  If you designate a
     sector that doesn't have a direct warp lane, your ship's
     computer will plot your course, show the path and the number
     of hops (and turns) the trip will use, and ask you if you
     want to engage your AutoPilot.  You will be able to use the
     Autopilot in three different modes.  The default is Alert
     mode.  This will suspend your travel in any sector where
     there is a planet, port, navagational hazard or other
     trader.  Once alerted to one of these items, you will be
     given several options.  It is up to you to make the decision
     that will best serve you or your corporation.  The second
     mode is Express.  This speeds you to your destination
     provided there are no enemy forces in your path.  The third
     mode is Single Step.  This was developed by an enterprising
     group of pioneers.  Their group was getting smaller due to
     bold exploration of sectors filled with mines, so the
     survivors manufactured an Autopilot that would stop in each
     sector.  This allowed them to scan the next sector for
     hazards before proceeding into it.  Select this option if
     you feel the need for caution.

<L>  Land on a Planet.  This option will enable you to colonize
     your planets, build a Citadel and do business there, pick up
     the fighters built by your colonists or pick up the
     production of Fuel Ore, Organics and/or Equipment.  You will
     see a list of all the planets.  Simply enter the number for
     the one you want to visit.  If you have purchased a Planet
     Scanner at the Hardware Emporium, it will automatically
     provide you with additional information about the planet.
     The Planet Scanner will also allow you to abort the landing
     procedure if, after looking at the defenses, you feel you
     may not be able to land successfully.  The display, once you
     have landed, shows the planet number, location, name, class
     and a chart detailing the commodities, production
     requirements and current inventories.  You will also see the
     citadel information and any planetary defenses.

<S>  Long Range Scan.  If you have purchased a scanner from the
     Hardware Emporium, you can use it to view adjacent sectors.
     All things in the Trade Wars universe have a density value
     and you can use your Density Scanner to display the relative
     density of the neighboring sectors and determine if there
     are any Navagational Hazards.  You will also be warned of
     any non-standard, undefinable mass.  You can then use that
     information to determine what's next door.  If you have a
     Holographic Scanner, you will be able to see ports, planets,
     hazards and other players all for just the cost of one turn.

<R>  Release Beacon.  Choose this when you want to launch one
     of the Marker Beacons you purchased at the Hardware
     Emporium.  You will need to decide what message your
     beacon will send when you launch it. (Limit 41 characters)

<W>  Tow SpaceCraft.  This option lets you toggle your tractor
     beam on and off.  The computer will ask you which trader in
     your current sector you wish to tow.  You can tow an
     unmanned ship only if you own the ship and know the ship's
     password.  The computer will then calculate (using the size
     difference between the two ships) the number of turns you
     will use for each sector you tow this trader and his/her
     ship.  You can then use the Move option to go to an adjacent
     sector or you can engage your AutoPilot to move you and your
     "passenger".  Type 1 TransWarp drives were not made to be used
     in conjunction with tractor beams, so if you use your Type 1
     TransWarp, the tractor beam will automatically shut down.
     Type 2 TransWarp drives can be used with a ship in tow.
     The person you are towing will not enter a sector until you
     have safely entered.  The tractor beam will act as a
     protective shield and will safeguard the towee from any
     damage from mines, offensive fighters or Quasar cannons.  If
     your ship is destroyed, the tractor beam will also be
     destroyed and the person you are towing will be left
     stranded.  To disengage the beam at any point, use this
     option again.

<N>  Move to NavPoint.  Navigation Points are sectors of particular
     relevance to you or your corporation.  They are assigned from
     the main menu with the "<Y> Set NavPoints" option.  All Nav units
     are pre-programmed with info on Sector 1 (Terra), and (if the
     sysop wishes) StarDock Sector, and there are four other definable
     points.  Navigation info is available on any sector in FedSpace,
     or any sector containing one or more of your fighters.  This info
     includes any planet or port details for that sector.

Computer and Information

<C>  Onboard Computer.  This command will activate your on-board
     computer.

<X>  Transporter Pad.  The display will show the transport range
     of your ship and a list of ships and their locations to
     which you can beam yourself.  Make sure you know the
     password!

<I>  Ship Information.  This will display your statistics.

     Trader Name......Your alias in the game
     Rank and Exp.....The experience points you have
                      accumulated, the number of alignment
                      points you have accumulated and the
                      title you have received
     Times Blown Up...The number of times your ship has been
                      destroyed
     Ship Name........The name of the ship you are now using
     Ship Info........Manufacturer and model
                      Ported = The number of times this ship
                      has docked at a Trading Port
                      Kills = Number of other player's ships
                      destroyed by this ship
     Turns to Warp....How many turns used to move this ship
                      one sector
     Date Built.......The date this ship was purchased
     Current Sector...Your current location
     Turns to Warp....The number of turns you will use
                      moving this ship to an adjacent sector
     Turns Left.......Number of turns remaining for this
                      ship
     Total Holds......Number of holds this ship is carrying
                      (This display also shows the breakdown
                       of the cargo in the holds)
     Additional information includes all the special equipment
     your ship has and the number of credits you have on your
     ship.

<T>  Corporate Menu.  This will give you information about all
     the corporations in the game.

<U>  Use Genesis Torpedo.  If you are carrying a Genesis
     Torpedo, you will be able to detonate it and create one of
     the several types of planets using this command.  These will
     create your new world quickly.  You will be advised of the
     planet type before you have to name it so you can assign an
     appropriate name.

<J>  Jettison Cargo.  If your holds are full of some cargo you
     just can't unload on any nearby port or planet, you may
     use this selection to unceremoniously dump your holds
     into space.  Remember that FedLaw prohibits littering in
     FedSpace.  Dumping holds filled with colonists will leave
     a negative impression on your alignment.

<B>  Interdict Control.  If you are piloting an Interdictor
     Cruiser, use this option to set the generator powering the
     Interdictor on or off.  If it is on, an enemy will not be
     able to warp out of the sector during an attack.

Tactical

<A>  Attack Enemy SpaceCraft.  When you encounter an opponent,
     other creature or unmanned ship in a sector you have the
     option of going on the offense and attacking.  The
     controller will ask you how many of your fighters you want
     to use in the attack.  When you are much stronger than your
     opponent, there is a chance that the opponent will warp out
     of the sector.  If you are very careful with the amount of
     firepower you use in your attack, there may be significant
     salvage available after you win.  Attacking others can (and
     probably will) affect your alignment.  If you attack a
     pirate or known terror you will get good points.  On the
     other hand, if you decide to pick on some good soul you will
     go down the ladder of righteousness.

<E>  Use Subspace Ether Probe.  Launch the Probe you purchased at
     the Hardware Emporium.  Send the unmanned spy off to its
     destination sending information back to you from every
     sector it passes through.  Remember that this device has
     no defensive capabilities so if it encounters any enemy
     fighters, it will be destroyed.

<F>  Take or Leave Fighters.  This enables you to deploy your
     fighters.  You will have several options so you can
     customize your defenses.  You can leave fighters as
     either Personal so they recognize only you as an ally or
     you can leave them as Corporate so any member of your
     corporation will be treated with respect.  Fighters can
     be Offensive, Defensive or Toll.  Defensive fighters
     defend your territory.  They bar opponents from entering
     a sector and will fight when attacked.  Offensive
     fighters will send out an attack group on any poor soul
     who happens into their sector.  The size of the attack
     group depends on the fighter support escorting the
     intruder.  After the initial attack, offensive fighters
     fall back to defend their territory.  Toll fighters
     simply stop the casual passers-by and ask them for money
     to help with your cause.  The number of Toll Fighters
     deployed will determine the amount of the toll charged.
     Toll fighters, as all other fighters, will fight back if
     attacked.

<G>  Show Deployed Fighters.  This display can be a very
     useful tool as you plan your military strategies.  The
     information shown contains the sector number where the
     fighters are located, the quantity of fighters there,
     whether the fighters are Personal or Corporate, the
     strategic mode they are in (Offensive, Defensive or Toll)
     and any tolls they have collected.

<H>  Handle Space Mines.  Mines can be a very convincing way
     of marking your territory.  This selection will let place
     both Limpet and Armid mines and allows you place or pick up
     the mines.  You will be able to choose whether to set the
     mines as Personal or Corporate. Personal mines will
     recognize only you and Corporate mines will recognize any
     member of your corporation. Mines don't always work, but it
     stands to reason that the more mines there are in a sector,
     the more likely one is to detonate (or attach in the case of
     Limpet mines).

<K>  Show Deployed Mines.  This display is similar to the Show
     Deployed Fighters.  You get information about the sectors
     containing your Personal and/or Corporate Limpet and Aramid
     mines and how many mines are located in each of those
     sectors.  In the case of Limpet mines, you will get two
     displays.  One will show the deployed mines just waiting for
     your unsuspecting enemy.  The other display is Activated
     mines - it shows those mines which have attached to ships
     and where they are.

<O>  Starport Construction.  If there is not a Starport in the
     sector, this menu selection will display the Starport
     Construction Menu.  Starports are available throughout
     the universe.  You may decide that you want your own
     customized commerce center in a place you specify instead
     of using the ones built by others.  You will see a
     detailed graph of the different port classes, the
     products they can import/export and the initial
     construction costs.  The license bureau will check to see
     that there is a planet in the sector to provide materials
     for the construction.  They will also check for
     sufficient funding to support the undertaking.  Be sure
     to leave the specified amount of materials on the planet
     every day during the construction phase or the building
     will not progress.  If there is already a Starport in the
     sector, the Upgrade Starport Menu will be displayed.
     This allows you to increase the trading levels of any or
     all of the commodities.  The universe can support only so
     many ports.  If the Starport Construction request tells
     you that the universe is full, then you have to destroy
     an existing port before you can begin construction on
     your new one.  (See PORT AND TRADE)

<Y>  Set NavPoints.  Use this option to log important sectors to
     your navigation unit.  You can then plot a course to one of
     these sectors at any time from the NavPoint menu (<N> from
     main menu).

Global Commands

     These features can be accessed from any prompt in the game.  The
     command must be the first character on any prompt line, and
     a given command cannot be accessed from within itself.

<`>  Fed. Comm-Link.  This enables you to send a message to all
     other players in the game over the global Federation comm-link.
     Players can turn off the Fed. comm-link in the computer menu
     (Personal Settings), and will no longer receive global messages.

     You use this feature in either of two ways:

     1) Type ` and press <ENTER>.  You will be prompted to type in
        your message, pressing <ENTER> to send each line.  Sending
        a blank line will terminate the transmission.  In this way,
        you can send any number of lines, each 155 characters or
        less.

     2) Type ` followed immediately by your one line message.

        Example: `Is anyone listening?

        Upon pressing <ENTER>, this one line message will be sent,
        and the transmission will be terminated, returning you to the
        previously active prompt.  As before, this line can be up to
        155 characters in length.

<'>  Sub-space Radio.  This enables you to send a message to all
     other players in the game who are tuned to your radio channel.  By
     default, everyone starts on radio channel zero until changed
     in the computer menu (Personal Settings).

     You use this feature in either of two ways:

     1) Type ' and press <ENTER>.  You will be prompted to type in
        your message, pressing <ENTER> to send each line.  Sending
        a blank line will terminate the transmission.  In this way,
        you can send any number of lines, each 155 characters or
        less.

     2) Type ' followed immediately by your one line message.

        Example: 'Is anyone listening?

        Upon pressing <ENTER>, this one line message will be sent,
        and the transmission will be terminated.  As before, this
        line can be up to 155 characters in length.

<=>  Hailing Frequencies.  This enables you to send a message over a
     secured channel to another trader.  This is not to be confused with
     private mail.  Messages sent here are not stored in the traders
     mail log.

     You use this feature in any of three ways:

     1) Type = and press <ENTER>.  You will be prompted to type in
        the name of the trader you are contacting.  Assuming this trader
        is valid, your computer will send a hailing message.  If the
        user is online, a private channel will be opened.  You will then
        be prompted to type in your message, pressing <ENTER> to send each
        line.  Sending a blank line will terminate the transmission.  In
        this way, you can send any number of lines, each 155 characters or
        less.

     2) Type = followed immediately by the trader you are contacting.

        Example: =Kal Durak

        Upon pressing <ENTER>, assuming this trader is valid, your computer
        will send a hailing message.  If the user is online, a private
        channel will be opened.  You will then be prompted to type your
        message, pressing <ENTER> to send each line.  As before, sending a
        blank line will terminate the transmission, and you can send any
        number of lines, each 155 characters or less.

     3) Type = followed immediately by the trader you are contacting,
        followed then by a comma, and the one line message to be sent.

        Example: =Kal Durak, Meet me at Stardock!

        Upon pressing <ENTER>, your computer will attempt to contact
        this trader.  If this is a valid trader name, the one line
        message will be transmitted, and the transmission will end.
        This line, including trader name, is limited to 155 characters.
        If that trader is not available at the moment, the message will not
        be received.

     In all of the above cases, if the trader is not online, the message
     will be routed to the Galactic M.A.I.L. Service.

     Establishing a two-way secured comm-link:

        Once the computer establishes the identity of the trader you are
        contacting, a "hailing" message is sent.  If that trader wishes,
        he or she may then contact you with the "Hailing Frequencies"
        command.  In this way, a secured two-way comm-link can be
        established between two traders.  The transmission works just as
        before, accept that the incoming message banner for this trader
        will be shortened to the trader's name and a colon.  For example,

        Kal Durak:
        I'm already at Stardock...

        This is meant to facilitate lengthy chat sessions between traders.

COMPUTER MENU

Navigation

<F>  Course Plotter.  This will show the number of turns and hops
     it  will take to get from any sector in the universe to
     another.  You can use this tool to avoid any surprise as
     you travel between sectors.  You know the universe is
     full of unexplained phenomenon and just because you got
     from your home sector to this sector with a great port in
     five moves doesn't mean you'll get back in five moves.

<I>  Inter-Sector Warps.  This selection will show you the
     warps lanes connected to any sector in the universe that
     you have explored.  You just enter the sector number and
     the computer will show you every sector directly linked
     to that sector.  The computer will not have data to
     display for those sectors you have yet to explore.

<K>  Your Known Universe.  As you travel through space, you
     will be creating your personal travelogue.  This will
     store information about the sectors you've explored.
     Your computer will use this information to give you your
     Port Reports and Inter-Sector Warps.  You may wish to see
     what sectors you have (or don't have) in your travelogue.
     This option will tell you.  You will see what percentage
     of the universe you have visited and the computer will
     ask if you want the list of Explored or Unexplored
     sectors.  When you reply, you will get a list of sector
     numbers.

<R>  Port Report.  This report gives you relatively up-to-date
     information about any port located in a sector which you
     have explored.  All you have to do is enter the sector
     number in which the port is located.  You will see items
     being traded at the port, the status of each of those
     items (whether the port is buying them or selling them),
     the number of units the port is willing to trade (and
     what percentage of maximum that number represents) and
     how many of each of the commodities you have in your
     holds.  If for some reason you get the message that the
     computer has no information on that port and you are sure
     there is a port in the sector you indicated, there may be
     enemy forces in that sector interfering with your
     computer's scan.

<U>  T-Warp Preference.  Once you have a TransWarp drive, this
     option will let you chose whether or not you want to have
     the prompt to use this feature each time you try to move to
     a non-adjacent sector.  If you say "Yes", you will get the
     prompt.  If you say "No", you will simply get the autopilot
     prompt.  The next time you want to use the TWarp drive, you
     will have to go into this option to restart it.

<V>  Avoid Sectors.  You will sometimes find sectors
     containing things that are detrimental to your success in
     the game.  This function will avoid those sectors when
     doing any course plotting.  You just have to enter the
     sector or sectors to be by-passed before you use the
     computer to plot a course or to establish a route for
     your AutoPilot.  If the computer encounters a situation
     where there is not possible route between the sectors you
     requested, then all voids will be cleared and will have
     to be re-entered before any future course calculations.

<X>  List Current Avoids.  When you want to see just what
     sectors are being avoided when the computer charts your
     course, use this selection.  You can use this information
     to determine if you want to make any changes.  Due to the
     limited functionality of this module of the computer, if
     you want to remove one or more avoided sectors from the
     list, you must clear the entire list and re-enter the
     sector numbers you still want to bypass.

<!>  Computer Help.  Display the portion of the documentation
     describing the Computer functions.

<Q>  Exit Computer.  This option will return you to the bridge
     of your ship.

Miscellaneous

<A>  Make Announcement.  Do you have something you want to
     tell everyone in the game?  If so, prepare your
     proclamation and enter it.  You will have 155 characters
     for your announcement and it will be displayed in the
     Daily Log for everyone to read as they enter the game.

<B>  Begin Self-destruct Sequence.  If you have managed to
     make a real mess of things and the only way to continue
     is to start from scratch, then go ahead and use this
     command.  You will escape from your ship moments before
     it self-destructs.  Think it over carefully before you
     hit the button.  This will not only destroy your ship and
     all its inventory, but it will also affect your rank and
     alignment.  Your spirit takes two days to migrate back to
     Sector 1, so you won't have any turns the day after you
     self-destruct.

<N>  Personal Settings.

     ANSI graphics

       Toggles the display of colors and ANSI displays.  Turning if off
       will replace the displays with text-only alternatives.

     Animation display

       By turning off animation, many of the longer menus and graphics will
       be skipped, making the game display faster.

     Page on message

       If you want to receive a beep when someone sends you a message, turn
       this option on.  If the beep annoys you, turn it off.

     Sub-space radio channel

       Specify which channel (if any) you wish to use for sub-space radio
       transmission and reception.  Setting this to 0 turns off use of the
       radio.

     Federation comm-link

       If the comm-link messages are just getting in your way, you can turn
       them off with this option.

     Receive private hails

       If you'd rather not be bothered by other Traders, you can disable the
       hailing notification.  Use with caution, because you might miss an
       important message now and then.

     Persistent info display

       If this option is enabled, the "Quick-stats" key, </>, will toggle the
       display on and off.  While on, the info will be displayed at the top
       of the screen.

       If this option is disabled, the "Quick-stats" key will simply display
       the information on the next few lines.

     Silence ALL messages

       If you just don't like to be bothered, or if you're using sensitive
       scripts, you can turn off all game messages.  This includes all
       multiplayer notifications (Player enters sector, etc), and any messages
       sent by other players.  You're flying blind here, so be warned.

<O>  Change Ship Settings.  This option offers you an additional
     level of protection for all the ships you own.  This lets
     you establish a password that players will need to know to
     be able to use your ship.

<P>  Fire Photon Missile.  You can fire your Photon Missile
     into the adjacent sector and run in to do your damage.
     Remember that the timer is running as soon as the missile
     is launched so be quick!

<M>  Read Your Mail.  Check your messages.  This gives you a chance to
     view any new personal messages currently logged with the Galactic
     M.A.I.L. (Mutual Anachronous Interchange Log).  These messages are
     only removed from the log after you exit the game IF YOU HAVE READ
     THEM HERE.  Mail generated by Trade Wars (not players) while you are
     online will be displayed to your screen in real-time, and also placed
     into your mail where they will remain until read.

<S>  Send Mail.  Log a message with the GMS (Galactic M.A.I.L. Service).
     When you need to get a message to one of the other players, this will
     serve your need.  Keep entering the lines of your message until you
     are done.  To complete your message, simply press the enter key on a
     blank line.  You do not need to know the player's entire name.  If you
     have part of it, your computer will search the GMS database and prompt
     you when it finds a match.

<T>  Current Ship Time.  This will display the time and date
     stored in your ship's computer.  (Remember, the game
     began in the year 2002.)

<W>  Use Mine Disrupter.  You are exploring a new region of
     the universe and as you single-step your way along, your
     scanner shows a number of mines in the next sector.  Send
     one of the Mine Disrupters you purchased at the Hardware
     Emporium into this mined sector so you don't have to take
     the damage to your ship.  The disrupters will also disarm
     any Limpet mines that may be in the sector.  If the first
     Disrupter doesn't disarm all the mines, you can send in
     another.

Displays

<C>  View Ship Catalog.  This tool lets you view the
     specifications for all the available ships in the game.
     You can get a list of the ships and choose which ever one
     strikes your fancy.  The display will show the following
     information -

               Basic Hold Cost
               Main Drive Cost
               Computer Cost
               Ship Hull Cost
               Base Cost
               Minimum and Maximum Holds
               Maximum Fighters
               Maximum Shields
               Number of Moves per Day
               Maximum Number of Mines
               Maximum Number of Genesis Torpedoes
               Offensive Odds for Combat
               Maximum Number of Marker Beacons
               TransWarp Drive Capability
               Long Range Scanner Capability
               Planet Scanner Capability

     In addition to all this information, there is a brief
     narrative about the capabilities and shortcomings of each
     model.

<D>  Scan Daily Log.  This will re-display the Daily Journal
     that you see when you enter the game.

<E>  Evil Trader Class.  This is a display of the titles to
     which you can aspire if you are of negative alignment.
     It shows the levels, titles and the number of experience
     points needed to attain that level.

<G>  Good Trader Class.  This is a display of the titles to
     which you can aspire if you are of positive alignment.
     It shows the levels, titles and the number of experience
     points needed to attain that level.

<H>  Alien Trader Ranks.  You will encounter traders from other
     galaxies as you make your way through the universe.  You
     can interact with these creatures the same as you do with
     the Traders native to your 1000 sectors.  Of course,
     aliens are either good or bad.  Their alignment (good or
     evil) can make a big difference in how you want to
     associate (or not associate) with them.  When you use
     this selection, your computer will tell you everything
     you need to know.

<J>  Planetary Specs.  The use of this display is very similar to
     that of the Ship Catalog.  A ? will show you a list of all
     the planet types.  Choose the one you would like to know
     more about and the display will produce a picture and a
     brief description of the planet.  It will also detail some
     of the pros and cons of that planet type.

<L>  List Trader Rank.  This choice will show you all the players
     in the game in order of experience.  Your prompt will ask
     if you would like the list to show the Titles of the
     players or their Values in Experience points.  Each
     trader will be displayed with his or her title or value,
     the number of the Corporation to which he/she belongs,
     and the type of ship currently being used.

<Y>  Personal Planets.  If you have planets that you want to
     keep as personal, you can view them using this option just
     as you can view Corporate Planets using the <L> option in
     the Corporation Menu.

<Z>  Active Ship Scan.  This display will show a list of all your
     ships, the ship number, location, ship type, fighters &
     shields and the number of hops to get to it.


PLANET MENU

<A>  Take All Products.  This will load your empty holds with
     the products available on the planet.  The dock workers
     will load your ship to the brim with as much of each of
     the products that is available beginning with the cargo
     of greatest value (Equipment) to the least value (Fuel
     Ore).

<C>  Enter Citadel.  You enter the Citadel (and display the
     Citadel Menu).  If there is no citadel on this planet,
     you will have the option to build one.  The necessary
     products and labor force needed in the construction will
     display.  You will not be issued a building permit if you
     don't have the necessary people and commodities.

<D>  Display Planet.  This will show the planet number, type,
     name and the alias of the player who created it.  There
     is also an informative chart showing how many colonists
     are working in each production area, how many units of
     each product are being produced daily, the quantity of
     each product currently available on the planet, and how
     many of each you have on your ship.  Citadel information
     including level, construction underway and credits in the
     vault is also available.

<M>  Change Military Levels.  You will want to move your
     fighters around to protect your territory.  This option
     will allow you to take fighters currently on the planet
     or to leave fighters you have escorting you.  The
     fighters on the planet are controlled by the Combat
     Control Computer (level 2) in the Citadel.  If there is
     no Combat Control Computer there, the fighters would
     better serve you patrolling the sector outside the
     planet.  Leaving fighters on a planet will designate the
     planet as yours.

<O>  Claim Ownership.  Let the entire universe know who
     controls the planet.  Use this option to set the planet
     as either Personal or Corporate.  This is a must when
     you've gone to all the trouble to capture one of your
     opponent's planets.

<P>  Change Population Levels.  Throughout the course of the
     game you may wish to change the distribution of your
     workforce among the commodities.  This selection provides
     you with an easy, efficient way to order your workers to
     the job you need done.

<S>  Load/Unload Colonists.  Colonizing your planets can
     contribute greatly to your trading profits.  This will
     enable you to leave the colonists you've brought from
     Terra or pack everyone up and move them to another
     planet.  Keep a close watch on your planet's population
     because many planets experience a growth/death cycle.  If
     your planet has too many people to support, the raw
     materials needed to produce your commodities will be used
     up by the surplus population and your production rates
     will be adversely affected.

<T>  Take or Leave Product.  This will let you specify to the
     dock workers which type of products you want to leave and
     which ones you want loaded on your ship.

<Z>  Try to Destroy Planet.  First you purchase Atomic
     Detonators from the Hardware Emporium.  That is the easy
     part.  You then have to fight your way into the sector
     containing the planet.  After battling the fighters,
     Quasar Cannons, and any other military defenses that may
     be there, you have the ability to lay your Atomic
     Detonators.  Colonists have been trained in the disarming
     of detonators.  Most of the training was rushed and
     provided by inexperienced teachers, so they aren't very
     good at it.  Most of their attempts literally go up in
     smoke, and if you are still on the planet when their
     attempt goes awry, you go awry with it.  You have the
     option of suing your conventional weapons to kill off the
     colonists before you lay the detonators so you don't run
     the risk of getting killed by their lack of skill.  If
     you're willing to risk the bad Karma to be a little
     safer, this might be the correct option for you.

<Q>  Leave This Planet.  Take off from the planet.

CITADEL MENU

<B>  Transporter Control.  Here is where you go to beam you and
     your ship to another sector.  The transporter range is
     limited, but with enough credits, you can also use this
     option to upgrade it's range.

<C>  Engage Ship's Computer.  Use this function to use all
     your Crai's power just as you would by choosing <C> from
     the Main Menu.

<D>  Display Traders Here.  This will show you the guest
     register of the other players who are parked in the
     Citadel.  The register gives you the name of the player,
     their ship type and how many fighters, shields and holds
     they have.  This information could prove very useful if
     you have just captured the planet from one of your
     opponents.

<E>  Exchange Trader Ships.  If the other players parked in
     the Citadel have specified their vehicle as available for
     trade, then you have the option of exchanging your ship
     for theirs.  Be sure to coordinate this carefully with
     the other members of your corporation.  Only C.E.O.'s can
     use Corporate Flagships so they are not available for
     trade.  If you have seized this planet from an opponent
     still parked in the Citadel, you may want to commandeer
     his ship for your own use.

<G>  Shield Generator Control.  If you have your level 5
     Citadel completed, you can use this option to store your
     shields.  You transfer your Ship's shields to the
     Planetary Shielding System using this option (10 ship
     shields = 1 planetary shield).  Stored shields will be
     used in the defense of your planet.  The Planetary
     Shielding System will protect your planet from your
     enemies.  You will thwart your rivals' attempts to
     incapacitate your defenses with Photon Missiles.  Your
     opponents will be unable to scan your planet.

<I>  Personal Info.  This selection will enable you to see all
     of your current statistics.  The information will display
     same as it does when you choose option <I> from the Main
     Menu.

<L>  Quasar Cannon R-level.  Use this option to set both the
     Atmospheric and Sector reaction levels.  The Quasar
     Cannon in your Level Three Citadel uses massive amounts
     of Fuel Ore.  Use this option to adjust the percentage of
     Ore on the planet used in this weapon's capability.
     PLEASE NOTE: The Quasar Cannon will use the entered
     percentage of Fuel Ore remaining on the planet for EACH
     SHOT it fires.  If you set the Sector value to 100% and
     a Scout Marauder with 5 fighters wanders into your
     sector, the Cannon will use all the Fuel Ore on your
     planet to blow the intruder into space dust.  If another
     player later tramps into your sector in a well-armed
     BattleShip your Cannon will sit idle due to lack of
     ammunition.  Another consideration when setting your
     percentages is that the accuracy of the Cannon is much
     better and the damage caused by the blast is greater when
     the target is in the planet's atmosphere.


<M>  Military Reaction Level.  Another method of customizing
     your protection, this will let you set the percentage of
     fighters stationed there to be used as offensive or
     defensive in case of an attack on the planet.  You must
     have a Combat Control Computer (Level Two Citadel or
     higher) to use this option.  The value you enter will be
     the percentage of fighters that will attack offensively
     as someone attempts to land on your planet.  The balance
     of your fighters will fall back for defense of the planet
     and Citadel.

<N>  Interdictor Control.  If you have upgraded your citadel to
     level 6, this will allow you to control the Interdictor
     generator on the planet.    You will want to use this in
     conjunction with a Quasar Cannon.  If the generator is on,
     an enemy ship cannot leave the sector.  This generator
     consumes a lot of fuel ore when used.  Make sure your Q-
     cannon is set most carefully.  Otherwise, the enemy can try
     to escape and deplete all the fuel ore on your planet.

<P>  Planetary TransWarp.  The instructions for this feature
     are in your Level Four Citadel.  Provided you have enough
     Fuel Ore to power the mammoth engine, you can move your
     planet to any sector where you currently have fighters
     stationed.

<R>  Remain Here Overnight.  You can sleep feeling safe and
     secure if you bed down inside the Citadel, out of the rat
     race.  You will have the protection of your planetary
     forces to guard you.  When you leave your ship, the valet
     will ask if you want others who enter the Citadel to have
     the privilege of exchanging ships with you.  It's
     perfectly within your rights to keep your ship for
     personal use only.

<S>  Scan This Sector.  This option will let you see
     everything in the sector around this planet.  The display
     will be the same as you get from option <D> in the Main
     Menu.

<T>  Treasury Fund Transfers.  If you don't like to carry a
     lot of credits on you when you're out exploring the
     universe, you can deposit your excess in the Citadel.
     You can withdraw the credits whenever you need them.  Be
     advised that the Treasury workers are quite lax in their
     security measures and anyone who enters the Citadel can
     withdraw any and all of the credits.

<U>  Upgrade Citadel.  Once your Citadel construction is
     complete, you may find you wish to upgrade.  Very few
     people are content with a Level One Citadel.  You will
     need more colonists and materials for each level of
     improvements.  Level Two has a Combat Control System
     which enables you to set the fighters deployed on the
     planet as offensive or defensive.  Level Three contains
     a Quasar Cannon which is a very powerful weapon, but uses
     a considerable amount of Fuel Ore to operate.  Level Four
     encloses the massive engine used for the TransWarp Drive.
     Level Five provides the power for the Planetary Shielding
     System.  The PSS will provide a sturdy shield for your
     planet which your enemies will have a hard time
     penetrating with fighters or photon missiles.  Level 6
     equips the planet with an Interdictor Generator.  If turned
     on, this generator will make it impossible for your enemy to
     escape from your Quasar Cannon.

<V>  Evict Other Traders.  Now that you've survived all the
     defenses your opponent placed to keep you out, you should
     be able to come in and take over, right?  Occasionally
     you go into a newly captured Citadel only to find the
     trader (or traders) who previously controlled the planet.
     No need to have them in your way.  Simply select this
     option to activate the Emergency Warning System in the
     Citadel.  It will alert these unwanted guests to some
     impending doom and their ships will blast off into orbit
     around the planet.  The system will list the traders as
     they escape.  You then may either stay in the Citadel out
     of harm's way or you can go out into the sector to
     inflict more damage on your enemy.

CORPORATION MENU

<D>  Display Corporations.  If you want to see how you and
     your corporation compare with others in the game or if
     you want to see who the members are of a specific
     corporation, use this selection.  You will asked if you
     want to List Corporations or Rank Corporations.  L will
     give you a listing of all corporations registered at
     Federation Hall showing the corporation's registration
     number and the date of incorporation and all corporate
     members with the C.E.O. labeled.  R will display a list
     of all corporations ranked by experience.  The list shows
     the rank, the corporate registration number and name, the
     C.E.O.'s name, the corporate alignment and the corporate
     experience.

<J>  Join a Corporation.  When you want to join forces with a
     corporation of the other traders, you will need to make
     arrangements to get your corporate security pass.  When
     a member of that corporation has approved your
     membership, use this option to join.  You will need to be
     of the same alignment as the C.E.O.  If at any time
     during your tenure with the corporation, your alignment
     is opposite that of the Chairman, you will be
     automatically ousted from the Corporation.

<M>  Make a New Corporation.  When you are prepared to make to
     move from independent trader to Corporate C.E.O., this
     option will file your Corporate Charter in the
     Federation's Hall of Records.  As C.E.O. you will have
     privileges that other players don't have such as owning
     an Corporate Flagship and sending Corporate Memos to all
     members of your Corporation.  You will be the one to
     determine whether your Corporation is good or evil.  As
     you go, so goes the Corporation.  A prospective member
     will have to be of the same alignment as you to join.

Corporations Only

<C>  Credit Transfer.  Use this option to transfer credits to
     or from your corporate associate.  You have to be in the
     same sector as the corporation member with whom you want
     to exchange credits.

<F>  Fighter Transfer.  Use this option to transfer fighters
     to or from your corporate associate.  You have to be in
     the same sector as the corporation member with whom you
     want to exchange fighters.

<H>  Mines Transfer.  Use this option to transfer mines to or
     from your corporate associate.  You have to be in the
     same sector as the corporation member with whom you want
     to exchange mines.

<S>  Shields Transfer.  Use this option to transfer shields to
     or from your corporate associate.  You have to be in the
     same sector as the corporation member with whom you want
     to exchange shields.

<X>  Leave Your Corporation.  There may come a time when you
     feel you have to make a break with your current
     corporation.  You may want to form your own new
     corporation.  You may want to play the game with an
     alignment different from that of your corporation's
     members.  This will allow you to vacate your position in
     your corporation.  Remember that you will no longer have
     access to any of the corporation's assets.  If you are
     the C.E.O. the corporation will be dissolved and all
     corporate fighters will become rogue mercenaries.

<L>  List Corporate Planets.  This will display a detailed
     graph of your corporation's planets.  The information
     includes
     -the sector where the planet is located
     -the planet's name
     -the current population
     -the production rate for Fuel Ore, Organics and Equipment
     -the current inventories of the commodities
     -the number of fighters stationed there
     -the level of the Citadel (if any)
     -the number of shields (if any)
     -the amount of credits in the Citadel (if any)

<A>  Show corporate Assets and Member Locations.  This is a
     very handy tool to use in organizing your strategy with
     that of the others in your Corporation.  The information
     shown on this display is
     -the Corporation member's name
     -the sector where that member is located
     -whether or not the member is on a planet in that sector
     -the number of fighters, shields, mines and credits on
      him/her

C.E.O.'s Only

<T>  Send Corporate Memo.  When you want to give information
     to all those in your organization, use this option.
     Whether it is instructions on where you want to establish
     a new colony or a congratulatory dispatch for a job well
     done, you can send your message quickly and efficiently.

<P>  Corporate Security.  In a world where instances of
     computer crime run rampant, a C.E.O. can never be too
     careful.  Be sure you trust a player before you let him
     or her in your organization.  And just as with your BBS
     account, you can better maintain security if you change
     passwords occasionally.

<R>  Drop Corporate Member.  Do you have a problem with a
     member of your Corporation?  Is that member showing signs
     of insubordination?  You don't have to put up with the
     stress.  Simply drop this trouble maker.  Remember that
     the member can take any corporate assets on his/her ship
     when kicked out.


STARDOCK MENU

<C>  The CinePlex Videon Theatres.  You can smell the popcorn
     from the Hardware Emporium.  Come right in to see the
     latest releases from HollyWorld.  You can choose from
     several first-run offerings or you can opt for one of the
     classics.  Don't take too long to make up your mind
     because there are others waiting in line behind you.

<G>  The 2nd National Galactic Bank.  Here is the place to
     engage in matters of high finance.  You will be able to
     put credits into your or another trader's account.  You
     can take credits out of your account.  You can examine
     the balance in your account.  The bank allows only
     personal accounts.  Corporate funds should be stored in
     secured Citadels.

<H>  The Stellar Hardware Emporium.  This is the General Store
     of the Trade Wars Universe.  If you want it, they have it
     and if you have enough money, they'll sell it to you.

<P>  The Federal Space Police HQ.  The home of law enforcement
     in the galaxy.  Here you can register complaints against
     other players, collect rewards or see the wanted posters.

<S>  The Federation Shipyards.  This is the place where you
     can trade your ship in for a newer model or sell off some of
     those junk ships you've gathered as spoils from your
     victories.  You can see all the models available and all the
     specifications for each style.

<T>  The Lost Trader's Tavern.  Traders come here for more
     than just a drink and a meal.  Some of the more
     interesting features of this game can be found here if
     you ask the right questions.

HARDWARE MENU

<A>  Atomic Detonators.  These detonators are used in the
     destruction of planets.  If you don't have enough
     military to take out a planet, you can set Atomic
     Detonators and run like hell.  Warning: colonists have
     been trained to disarm these detonators.  These units are
     as unstable as they are powerful.  They can react like
     Corbomite Devices when an enemy attacks your ship, and
     they can also detonate by hitting mines or offensive
     fighters as you journey through the galaxy.

<B>  Marker Beacons.  Marker Beacons are the billboards of the
     Trade Wars universe.  They are an inexpensive way to make
     a statement.  They stay in the sector where they are
     launched until they are destroyed.  They have absolutely
     no defensive capability.  They are so fragile that if two
     are launched in the same sector, they both explode.

<C>  Corbomite Devices.  Corbomite devices are weapons to
     avenge the destruction of your ship.  If one of your
     opponents succeeds in obliterating your craft, that
     person may suffer substantial damage as well when your
     ship is equipped with one or more of these.  Corbomite
     devices can also be viewed as protection.  Your enemies
     may think twice about attacking you if you are armed with
     these.  With each additional device you add to your
     vessel, you increase your protection level.  You can have
     up to a Level 1500 Corbomite Device on some ships and the
     nice part is, your foe has no way to detect the device's
     presence on your ship.

<D>  Cloaking Device.  Cloaking devices can hide you from your
     rivals when you are away from your home sector.  If you
     feel you will be vulnerable, use your Cloaking Device to
     conceal your ship.  Your location will be unknown to even
     your Corporate associates who view the Member Location
     display.  Remember that the Cloaking Device will use a
     lot of your energy reserves and its effectiveness
     decreases the longer it's used.  A well-known consumer
     group has tested these devices and found that on the
     average, after 24 hours of use, you stand a good chance of
     being detected.  Cloaking Devices are relatively
     inexpensive, but because some of the components decompose
     quickly, they are a one-time use item.

<E>  SubSpace Ether Probes.  Ethereal Probes are quite useful
     when you want to know what wonders lie on the other side
     of the universe, but you don't want to use up your turns
     to explore.  You can launch the unmanned probes with a
     preset destination.  As they maneuver their way across
     the cosmos, they report back sector by sector.  They are
     quite inexpensive for the amount of information that can
     be obtained, but they are not sturdy.  They contain a
     self-destruct mechanism that is triggered when the probe
     reaches its destination.  The designers of the probe
     thought this would provide anonymity for anyone using the
     gadget.  This mechanism is so sensitive that it detonates
     when the probe encounters any enemy fighters.  Since it
     has no shielding capabilities, any ship it passes will be
     able to detect its presence.

<F>  Planet Scanners.  If you are planning an invasion of
     another player's planet, this scanner can show you the
     military system on the planet without landing.  Once you
     are in the sector, scan the planet.  You can see who
     created the planet, who currently controls the planet,
     and the military defenses installed there.  You won't
     find out the hard way that you don't have enough weapons
     to take over the enemy forces.

<M>  Space Mines.  New technology has been developed to provide
     traders with two types of mines.  The Aramid mines can be a
     very effective way of establishing your territory.  Space
     mines can cause serious damage to smaller craft and can be a
     real nuisance to larger vessels.  The Limpet mines are a
     clever development of the Donnelly Underground Development
     Group.  They simply sit almost invisible in a sector until
     an enemy ship passes by.  Once the enemy is close enough,
     they attach themselves to the ship.  The activated mines
     will report their whereabouts to you when you do scan for
     deployed mines.  This is a clever way to find out where your
     enemy is.  The Limpets can be removed by crews at the
     Stardock.  The latest technology has provided mines with
     sensors capable of recognizing the Federal I.D. codes.  This
     will keep the mines from detonating by your ship or your
     Corporation's ships (most of the time).

<P>  Photon Missiles.  Only owners of Missile Frigates or
     Imperial Starships can use these powerful weapons. 
     Shields, both Ship and Planetary, are excellent
     protection from the impact of this weapon.   However,
     once shields have been destroyed, Photon Missiles can be
     used to disable all Combat Control Computers (Level 2
     Citadels) and Quasar Cannons (Level 3 Citadels) and
     Interdictor Generators (Level 6 Citadels) on planets.  It
     neutralizes all mines and fighters stationed in a sector. 
     Be advised that the effect of these missiles is short-lived. 
     Get in, take care of your business and get out before the
     effect wears off.  You don't want to still be in the sector
     when the Quasar Cannons regain their strength.  Great care
     should be used in transporting these volatile weapons of
     destruction.  

<R>  Long Range Scanners.  These scanners can provide the
     explorer with multi-sector vision.  Your two options are
     a Density Scanner or a Holographic Scanner.  The Density
     Scanner is the cheaper and it provides the user with the
     relative density of the surrounding sectors.  It will also
     indicate a warning if there is a non-standard undefinalble
     mass.  You can use that information to determine what may be
     in the neighborhood.  If you have sufficient funds, you can
     purchase a Holographic Scanner which has both Density and
     Holographic capabilities.  Using the Holographic mode,
     you can see what and who is in the sectors adjacent to
     the one you are currently occupying.  The scanner in
     Holographic mode uses a small amount of your ship's fuel
     (one turn's worth) but that is a small price to pay when
     you consider the information and security it can provide.

<S>  Mine Disrupters.  If you run across a heavily mined
     sector but you really need to go in there, send in a Mine
     Sweeper to clear your path.  They can absorb the damage
     so you don't have to or they can deactivate the limpets.

<T>  Genesis Torpedoes.  Much improved since the first models,
     these torpedoes can provide the foundation for the
     production of your trading commodities.  Depending on the   
     planet type created by the torpedo, planet will be able to
     support a varying number of colonists.  The colonists can
     provide the labor needed to mine the Fuel Ore, grow the
     Organics and manufacture the Equipment and Fighters you
     will use in your trading company.  Some planet types
     are better than others at producing the commodities.  You
     might want to check the Planetary Specs in your Onboard
     Computer.  You have no control over what planet type results
     from the Torpedo's explosion.  That is determined by
     conditions in the sector.

<W>  TransWarp Drives.  Only Imperial Starships, Corporate
     Flagships and Havoc Gunstars can be fitted with these massive
     drives.  TransWarp consumes an enormous amount of Fuel Ore so
     make sure you have a source of Ore for your return trip, too.
     The TransWarp Drive uses a homing device, so you should have
     at least one fighter in your destination sector.

     The Type 1 TransWarp drive is standard, and will not function
     with a tractor beam engaged.

     The Type 2 TransWarp drive is TransWarp Tow capable.

<Y>  Psychic Probes.  Bartering at the ports is one of the
     main elements of this game.  You get experience points
     for making a good deal.  The better the deal, the more
     points you get.  Psychic Probes are the next best thing
     to insider trading, and they're legal.  If you want to
     see exactly where your offer is compared to what they
     would have accepted, you need one of these probes.  It
     will not only show you where you went wrong, but it will
     also help you improve your trading skills.

SHIPYARDS MENU

<B>  Buy a New Ship.  When you are ready to upgrade, or if you
     need a specialized ship, come to the Shipyards and talk
     to Cal Worthington XXI about a trade-in.  You will be
     offered a fair price for your current ship.  They will
     take anything in your trade such as fighters,
     accessories, mines, etc. so if you're trying to get a lot
     on your trade-in, load your ship up before you talk to
     them.  If you don't want to use all your extras in the
     trade, you might want to leave as much as you can in a
     secure place and pick it up after you purchase your new
     ship.  New ships are very basic models.  The extras are
     available at the Hardware Emporium and the Class 0 ports.

<S>  Sell Extra Ships.  A display with all your ships in orbit
     will appear.  Choose which ones to sell off.  You will be
     able to see the ship number, name, type, location and how
     many fighters and shields are on each ship.

<E>  Examine Ship Specs.  This is the same information
     available to you from your ship's on-board computer, but
     in includes (for ANSI users only) a picture of each ship,
     both top and front view.  You may want to review the ship
     specifications one last time before you make your
     purchase.

<P>  Buy Class 0 Items.  After you purchase your ship, you may
     need to equip it with a few of the items normally
     purchased at the Class 0 ports.  You wouldn't want to
     take that brand new beauty out unprotected, would you?
     The merchants in the shipyards have obtained fighters,
     shields and holds from "trade-ins" so they are offering
     them right here where you buy your ship as a convenience
     to you.  Be forewarned that you will be paying a premium
     price for this convenience.

<R>  Change Ship Registration.  It's not paranoia when they're
     really out to get you.  If your foes are tracking you
     down by reading the logs at the StarPorts or they've
     received information on your ship from a loose-tongued
     fool at the tavern, go to this back room in the offices
     of the Shipyards.  For a hefty fee, you can get revised
     registration papers on your ship and christen it with a
     new, untraceable name.

TAVERN MENU

<A>  Make an Announcement.  Do you have something of interest
     for all the patrons of the tavern?  If so, pay the fee
     and post your announcement.  It will stay there until the
     next announcement is posted.

<B>  Buy Something from the Bar.  Had a trying day?  Want a
     little something to soothe your nerves?  Order up
     whatever your heart desires.  You might even get it in a
     clean glass.  Remember FedLaw says, don't drink and fly.

<C>  Eavesdrop on Conversations.  See that group of
     individuals gathered at the table in the darkest corner
     of the tavern?  They seem to be engaged in some very
     engrossing dialogue.  If you would care to listen in and
     maybe even add some remarks of your own, use this option.

<E>  Order Some Food.  You really need to keep your strength
     up so you can take on the challenges of the cosmos.
     Order up the Blue Plate Special (the food is blue, not
     the plate) and nourish yourself with some of the most
     memorable edibles this side of Barlaam.

<G>  Try Your Hand at Tri-Cron.  Do you feel lucky, Punk?  Put
     your money down and see if you can beat the odds.  A
     simple game of chance might relax you and you never know,
     you might come away a big winner.  The game is easy - the
     detailed instructions are available in the Tavern.  The
     cost of playing is based on the size of the Top Winner's
     Jackpot.  You'll have 10 rounds against the house.  If
     you win, the payback is 2 to 1.  If you're the top
     winner, you receive the accumulated jackpot.

<T>  Talk to the Grimy Trader in Back.  Not much to look at,
     but he can be a wealth of information.  Depending on how
     many drinks he's had, his facts may be a bit suspect.
     Just ask him about a specific topic, give him a little
     inducement and he'll tell you what he knows.  If you
     speak to him respectfully, he'll be fair to you.
     Otherwise he might try to take advantage of your need for
     information.  You'll have to pay dearly for it, but he
     can sometimes get you information on specific Traders.

<U>  Use the Facilities.  When Mother Nature calls, this
     option will allow you to answer.  Feel free to read the
     graffiti to keep yourself entertained.  You can even add
     some of your own prose or poetry but beware of what may
     be lurking in the next stall.

<;>  Join conversation.  This is a global command while you're
     visiting the tavern.  Simply type this command, followed
     by the text you want others in the tavern to see.  You can
     enter a multi-line mode by pressing this key and then a
     carriage return.  Remember that this is a public establishment,
     so don't say anything you wouldn't want anyone else to hear.

FEDPOLICE HEADQUARTERS MENU

<A>  Apply for a Federal Commission.  The Federation awards
     commissions to those individuals who have shown
     themselves to be highly experienced and law abiding.  If
     you believe yourself to qualify, apply at the Police
     Headquarters.  If the Feds grant you a commission, you
     will be able to procure an Imperial Starship.  This is a
     very powerful ship but with it comes a lot of
     responsibility.  The Federation may call upon you to aid
     their cause of maintaining law and order throughout the
     universe.  There are a limited number of Starships
     available, so apply for your commission as soon as you
     can.

<C>  Claim a Federation Reward.  After you have done your duty
     as a good FedLaw abiding citizen, you will want to claim
     the reward that is rightfully yours.  March right into
     the Police HQ and tell the sergeant that he no longer has
     to worry about the scumbag you terminated.  Be sure to
     put the reward money to good use.

<E>  Examine the Ten Most Wanted List.  There is a listing
     available in the FedPolice building of the most corrupt
     players in the game.  This list shows the level of evil
     the player has achieved, the corporation to which he/she
     belongs, the number of bounties posted on that player and
     the total reward for that player's demise.

<P>  Post a Reward on Someone.  Would you like to make it a
     little more rewarding for someone to get one of the
     players on the Most Wanted list?  You can offer as small
     or as large a payment as you would like.  Just see the
     officer on duty and tell him you want to post a reward.
     You will be shown the list of the Most Wanted criminals.
     Tell the nice officer which one you would most like to
     see brought to justice and how much you want to give to
     help in the cause.

BANK MENU

<D>  Make a Deposit.  You can inform the TellBorg that you
     wish to deposit some or all of the credits you have with
     you.  The transaction is recorded instantly so you don't
     have to wait three days for your deposit to be reflected
     in your account.

<E>  Examine Balance.  You might want to see if that other
     trader who promised you a reward for helping out with the
     Ferrengi has come through with the credits.  You might
     only want to check your funds to see if you can go on a
     spending spree at the Hardware Emporium.  This selection
     can put the answer at your fingertips.

<T>  Transfer Funds.  If you need to get funds to a Trader who
     is not in your corporation, this option will authorize
     you to make a deposit in that other Trader's account.
     Naturally, you must have the credits to be able to
     transfer them.

<W>  Withdraw Funds.  Saving can really pay off.  If your ship
     has been destroyed and you don't want to start from
     scratch in a Scout, a nest egg in the Galactic Bank can
     allow you to come right back with the ship of your
     choice.  Use this option to take your savings and spend
     them any way you choose.  You and only you have the
     authorization to withdraw credits from your account.
