                          TW2002 Special Commands

TW handles special startup commands for generating reports and to handle
other needs.  TW2002 can only be run from the command line with these special
commands.  TW is only designed to be played from within TWGS and cannot be
played from a DOS prompt. 

Note also that these commands can only be issued when TWGS is online.  If
TWGS is not running, the command will fail to run.

To issue a command to TW2002 from the command line, use this format:

TW2002 COMMAND=[Command] DATA=[Datapath]

Where [Datapath] is the path to the game that will process this command.  For
example, if TWGS is located at C:\TWGS and you've placed a game in the
default location, the path would be DATA=C:\TWGS\GAME\TW1.

[Command] can be any of the following:

RANKS : TW2002 will generate the ranking files for both player rankings and
the corporation ranking.  These and all output files will be placed into the
standard subdirectory OUTPUT off of the game directory.

STATS : TW2002 will update the game stats, generating a file called
TWSTATS.TXT in the OUTPUT subdirectory.  This list will contain all
configuration settings as well as dynamic game stats like active players,
fighter count, port value, etc, that would normally be found at the S and V
screens.

Additional commands will be added as necessary.
